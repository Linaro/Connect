                Since 2010, Linaro Connect has been the event to attend if you are interested in open source software development for Linux,
                tools and the various vertical segment ecosystems that use Arm processors. While the event continues to evolve, one thing
                stays the same – it revolves around engineering and will consist of a mix of industry keynotes, engineering presentations
                and discussions, and collaborative engineering hacking sessions.

                Linaro Connect Vancouver has now ended. The next Linaro Connect will be in Bangkok, Thailand from April 1-5, 2019. Details on registration will be <a href="/register/">available soon</a>.

                <p>
                        Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019 will be the 25th Connect since Linaro started in June 2010.
                        Hundreds of the world’s best Linux on ARM developers come to Linaro Connect each time because
                        they know it is the leading place to meet with the global community and to learn about what is
                        going on in the industry.
                        
                        Sponsorship of the event puts your brand in front of all the event attendees – both the 400+
                        on-site and all those who participate remotely, as well as the thousands who view the website
                        and social media before, during and after the event.
