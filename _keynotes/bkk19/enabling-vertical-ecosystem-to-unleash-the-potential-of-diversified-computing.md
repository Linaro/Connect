    The future is an intelligent digital world, where everything is to be sensible, connected to the cloud and AI enabled. That brings huge amount of information, and the relative calculation power
    requirements. However the scenarios for computing applications are varied. The diversity of applications and the resulting data are also diverse. Diverse applications produce diverse data,
    including text, images, and video, as well as structured, unstructured data.

    Because of the diversity of data, the appreciated computing architectures are also diverse. The Arm architecture has proved its value in the consumer-grade terminal industry. With the
    continuous innovation of Arm architecture, the performance of enterprise-grade Arm CPU will be greatly improved, Arm architecture is moving toward edge computing and data centers from the end, however an open ecosystem is critical for this leap.
    In this presentation Huawei will share their opinion and plans on how to build an open, competitive and win-win Arm data center ecosystem with industry partners.
