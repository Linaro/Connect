    A fundamental change is happening in the way software is made in the
    FOSS communities in the 21st century. These communities are now mature
    and the people who work there understand their work place differently.
    Over a decade and a half as more and more companies employ developers to
    contribute to FOSS and the communities become diverse, different
    expectations have begun to emerge from all stakeholders. These global
    communities have narrower social interactions, say, around a  water
    cooler or in person, therefore, putting a premium on the way their
    internal intermediated communication is  conducted. This talk will
    examine why Code of Conduct in this new world are on the rise and are a
    positive sign for mature FOSS projects that govern themselves and don't
    like suits. It will explore ways of  managing legal risk by drafting
    codes of conduct addressing bias, creating a frictionless reporting
    mechanism for legal incident response, and making the project a fun,
    inclusive productive place.
