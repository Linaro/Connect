    There's a lot of data relevant to the ARM world living in public datasets. In this session we are going to uncover some of the stories hiding within them. Who in the open source world is interested in ARM? What are their top projects? What do our users care for, and how can we help them move forward. If you ever need data to support your stories and use cases, come to this session to discover how to get plenty of it.
