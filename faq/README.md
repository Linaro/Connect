The deadline varies depending on the country that is hosting Connect as it will affect things like how long it takes to ship the equipment to that country, how long to allow for getting the equipment through Customs, etc.

As a result, the hardware request form itself will display the cut-off date for hardware requests for the current Connect.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Please note: Any hardware requests received after the displayed cut-off date will not be fulfilled as the shipping date will have been missed.
