excerpt: Sched-freq is the integration of the scheduler with cpufreq to yield scheduler-aware
  CPU frequency management. The purpose of the project will be briefly explained.
  The current design will be presented including things like the location of hooks
  in the scheduler and the implicit policy created by those hooks. Sched-freq will
  be contrasted with other cpufreq governors such as ondemand and interactive. The
  latest test results will be presented, along with next steps.
