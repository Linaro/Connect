  - title: Raising kernel quality to the next level
    date: 2020-03-26 10:00:00
    description: >
      Civilization runs on Linux. Today, the Linux kernel powers everything
      from plants, to cloud, to phones and IoT. Quality and security of the
      kernel is critical for the modern world. In this talk, Dmitry will
      describe the current state of the kernel quality, dynamics and
      challenges. Then he will share some of the recent developments in the
      kernel testing tools and processes and speculate about future tools.
      The final part of the talk is dedicated to principles and approaches
      that allow to build a scalable and cost-efficient testing process on
      the example of the syzbot system, and how these approaches can be
      extended to other testing systems.

        Dmitry Vyukov, Google, Senior Kernel Bug Slaughterer
        Dmitry works on dynamic testing tools at Google. His projects include
        a variety of bug detection tools for user-space and kernel, C/C++ and
        Go/Java; fuzzing tools (LibFuzzer, go-fuzz, syzkaller) and automation
        systems like syzbot. Dmitry also has an interest in concurrency,
        lock-free algorithms and language runtime implementations.

      Free, open source software is mainly founded on legal tools, like copyright, licenses. From a lawyer's perspective, that means "compliance". But I want to extend the concept of compliance, by outlining that complying with the rules means *respect* for other people's work and interest. With the paradigm shifting, with more and more workloads happening on the cloud, this is all the more a crucial point, needing respect, besides compliance.

  - title: "Let’s Butcher Software Development Analytics together: So you don’t have to when it really counts"
    date: 2020-03-27 11:30:00

      Lord Kelvin said "if you can't measure it, you cannot improve it". That may only be partially true. Instead, I reckon we must understand measurements and their context to comprehend what is going. In the context of software development, this would mean that we must measure the who, what, when, and how related to software development processes, but also know the context around this data to be able to answer the questions that allow managers to drive projects to their goals. I call it the “measurements in context” principle.

      This talk demonstrates this principle with humor by looking at Linaro’s projects. Let’s explore together what the software development analytics data shows us about Linaro’s open source projects. Then, let’s guess at what this could be telling us if we had no idea about Linaro. Finally, let’s apply the “measurements in context” principle to get sensible insights.

      This fun talk does not intend to answer real questions about Linaro, however, it does show in an approachable and memorable way how to do analytics on open source software. We will stumble in this presentation together over common problems only so you don’t have to do it when it really matters. Lessons learned from the CHAOSS project will also provide a solid foundation from which you can build your own analysis.

      During this talk, I will present an approach to drive your software development using data from both strategical and tactical points of view. Everything will rely on existing free, open source tools and knowledge from communities like CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics for Open Source Software) and InnerSource Commons.
