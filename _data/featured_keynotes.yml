- title: The Upstream Bubble
  description: >
    SOC vendors are often regarded as not being good opensource citizens. They tend to work downstream with upstream being an afterthought -- if it's even being thought of at all.  This is contrary to opensource community practices and can cause friction when engineers operating in these different modes try to interact.  There are often good reasons, and sometimes not-so-good reasons, for this type of behavior.  In this talk I will attempt to give more insight into why SOC vendors are downstream-focused, what types of issues motivate this behavior, and how we can better bridge these ecosystems to "pop the bubble".

- title: AI on Arm flagship Supercomputer Fugaku
  description: >
    Fugaku is the flagship next generation national supercomputer being
    developed by Riken R-CCS and Fujitsu in collaboration. Fugaku will have
    hyperscale datacenter class resource in a single exascale machine, with more
    than 150,000 nodes of sever-class Fujitsu A64fx many-core Arm CPUs with
    the new SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) with low precision math for the
    first time in the world, accelerating both HPC and AI workloads,
    augmented with HBM2 memory paired with each CPU, exhibiting nearly a
    Terabyte/s memory bandwidth for both HPC and AI rapid data movements.
    A64fx has demonstrated up to 8 times the performance of mainstream
    "Platinum" server processors for HPC workloads, and this game-changing
    performance has been realized through
    extensive co-design process involving the entire Japanese HPC community
    resulting in a highly HPC-optimzed CPU architecture.
    Fugaku also will likely to be the premier big data and AI/ML
    infrastructure; currently, we are conducting research to scale deep
    learning to more than 100,000 nodes on Fugaku, where we expect to obtain
    near top GPU-class performance on each node. The talk will give an
    overview of A64fx/Fugaku as well as cover some of the software ecosystem
    efforts to enable high-end HPC / BD / AI.

- title: "Coccinelle: 10 Years of Automated Evolution in the Linux Kernel"
  description: >
    Over the last 10+ years, we have been developing the Coccinelle C-program matching and transformation tool. Coccinelle allows developers to match and transform C code via a generalization of the familiar patch syntax. As Coccinelle is independent of the C preprocessor, Coccinelle rules can be applied across a code base, regardless of configuration constraints. Over the years, Coccinelle has been extensively used in Linux kernel development, resulting in over 7000 commits to the Linux kernel, and has found its place as part of the Linux kernel development process. This talk gives an introduction to the use of Coccinelle and gives an overview of its impact on the Linux kernel.
