- title: Big Data on ARM in practice with ThunderX
  description: >
    The University of Michigan(U-M), in partnership with Marvell, has built a Data Analytics cluster with ThunderX processors based on the Hadoop and Spark family of tools. We present information on the deployment and use of the cluster, which uses software packaged by the Linaro Big Data teams. We also present feedback to the Big Data on ARM community and future plans for development for Big Data on ARM at U-M as well.

- title: "Coccinelle: 10 Years of Automated Evolution in the Linux Kernel"
  description: >
    Over the last 10+ years, we have been developing the Coccinelle C-program matching and transformation tool. Coccinelle allows developers to match and transform C code via a generalization of the familiar patch syntax. As Coccinelle is independent of the C preprocessor, Coccinelle rules can be applied across a code base, regardless of configuration constraints. Over the years, Coccinelle has been extensively used in Linux kernel development, resulting in over 7000 commits to the Linux kernel, and has found its place as part of the Linux kernel development process. This talk gives an introduction to the use of Coccinelle and gives an overview of its impact on the Linux kernel.

- title: Arm in HPC
  description: >
    Arm-based systems are showing up in the HPC community and new silicon is coming. The architecture has also been selected for several of the exascale projects worldwide. Brent will talk about the aspects of Arm that are attractive to the HPC community, updates on projects and what we as a community can do to help accelerate adoption in this space.

    bio: >
      Brent has a long history of working in supercomputing community. Starting in the mid-80’s in Canada, he wrote compilers for Myrias Research. In the early 90’s he moved to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and worked on the adoption of parallel computing. In the early to mid 2000’s, he ran the BlueGene project for Livermore as well as the Lustre file system contract. Brent founded and was CEO at Whamcloud, a company formed to keep Lustre in play for HPC. After selling Whamcloud to Intel, he was General Manager for the High Performance Data Division for 5+ years. Along the way, Brent had a hand in starting Software-Carpentry.com, building the first Java compiler and founding the Student Cluster Competition now held worldwide at HPC events.
