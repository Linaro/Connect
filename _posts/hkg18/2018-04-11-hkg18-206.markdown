excerpt: 'Storage is one of the most important elements in enterprise area. It brings
  lots of challenges for the reason of different storage vendors(SP) and usage cases,
  so comes the Container Storage Interface(CSI) spec which is aimed to define an industry
  standard that will enable different plugins can work across the Container Orchestrations(CO).Apparently,
  this area is very critical for Arm enterprise ecosystem.

  In this presentation, Dennis will talk about one ''meta'' implementation of the
  CSI spec -- Rex-ray project and how it evolves and integrates into the COs like
  K8s, plus the challenges, the plan and the opportunity for Arm to get involved.'
