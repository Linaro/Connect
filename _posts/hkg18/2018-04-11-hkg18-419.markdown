excerpt: OpenHPC is slowly moving to Ansible, but with radically different deployments
  (x86 vs ARM, different components, network topology/technology, etc), we need to
  find the right balance between what stays in OpenHPC and what's private, as well
  as how to update our auto-generated documents from Ansible rules.
