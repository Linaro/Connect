excerpt:
  "Native CI and CD pipelines for Arm The industrial revolution brought a wave
  of automation and standardization to manufacturing. The world of software is going
  through a similar revolution in the form of automated CI and CD pipelines. However,
  most of this innovation has been focused on x86, while

  Arm developers have had to jump through hoops to achieve similar productivity. This
  talk demonstrates how you can achieve CD natively on Arm and reduce friction in
  software delivery."
