excerpt: "DRM (Digital Rights Management) solution secures video stream for transmission
  and playback.  It brings the complexity of media framework and driver porting in
  Secure-OS. Meanwhile, It seriously impacts on user\u2019s experience if Secure-OS
  takes too many time slices.\nArm TZMP1 solution leverages protected mode to prevent
  the normal-world OS (Rich-OS) from accessing the stream. Rich-OS can use existing
  media framework and driver to manipulate the playback flow path. This significantly
  mitigates the complexity of Secure-OS.\nArm provides an open source reference based
  on Linaro's work to facilitate the TZMP1 development of partners."

Session ID: HKG18-408
Session Name: HKG18-408 - A DRM solution using TZMP
Speaker: Ken Liu
Track: LHG


## Session Summary
DRM (Digital Rights Management) solution secures video stream for transmission and playback.  It brings the complexity of media framework and driver porting in Secure-OS. Meanwhile, It seriously impacts on user’s experience if Secure-OS takes too many time slices.
Arm TZMP1 solution leverages protected mode to prevent the normal-world OS (Rich-OS) from accessing the stream. Rich-OS can use existing media framework and driver to manipulate the playback flow path. This significantly mitigates the complexity of Secure-OS.
Arm provides an open source reference based on Linaro's work to facilitate the TZMP1 development of partners.
