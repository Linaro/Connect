## Session Summary
Trusted Firmware M

In October 2017, Arm announced the vision of Platform Security Architecture (PSA) - a common framework to allow everyone in the IoT ecosystem to move forward with stronger, scalable security and greater confidence. There are three key stages to the Platform Security Architecture: Analysis, Architecture and Implementation which are described at https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/platform-security-architecture.

Trusted Firmware M, i.e. TF-M, is the Arm project to provide an open source reference implementation firmware that will conform to the PSA specification for M-Class devices. Early access to TF-M was released in December 2017 and it is being made public during Linaro Connect. The implementation should be considered a prototype until the PSA specifications reach release state and the code aligns.
