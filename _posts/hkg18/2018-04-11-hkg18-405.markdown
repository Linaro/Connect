excerpt: The performance and accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks for visual
  recognition has reached the point where researchers generally consider them to be
  more accurate than traditional algorithmic approaches.  In this session we will
  examine implementation of a Binary Neural Network (BNN) on an FPGA with embedded
  processing system demonstrating four orders of magnitude greater performance than
  a software implementation on an embedded processor.  We will start with the basic
  concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks. Next, we will examine why FPGAs with
  embedded processors provide the necessary flexibility to accommodate network precision
  as well as varying number of neurons and layers. Finally, we will demonstrate a
  BNN running on a 96 board doing real-time traffic recognition at over 8,000 images
  per second.

## Session Summary
The performance and accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks for visual recognition has reached the point where researchers generally consider them to be more accurate than traditional algorithmic approaches.  In this session we will examine implementation of a Binary Neural Network (BNN) on an FPGA with embedded processing system demonstrating four orders of magnitude greater performance than a software implementation on an embedded processor.  We will start with the basic concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks. Next, we will examine why FPGAs with embedded processors provide the necessary flexibility to accommodate network precision as well as varying number of neurons and layers. Finally, we will demonstrate a BNN running on a 96 board doing real-time traffic recognition at over 8,000 images per second.
