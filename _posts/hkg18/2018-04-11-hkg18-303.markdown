excerpt: "The race to roll out new technology features, mobility services and autonomous
  vehicles continues to heat up across the tech and automotive industries. Over the
  past year, we\u2019ve seen a flurry of M&A activity, partnerships and new alliances,
  as automakers and their suppliers realize that the software and hardware required
  for autonomous driving is too complex for any one company to develop alone. \nWhile
  this is a step forward, greater collaboration across the entire industry is needed
  to accelerate autonomous driving. An open source platform for automakers to share
  information such as map data, miles driven and scenarios tested could speed up production
  cycles and decrease time-to-market.  \nAutomotive Grade Linux (AGL) is an open source
  project that is bringing together more than 100 members across the automotive and
  tech industries to develop a shared software platform for all in-vehicle applications
  from infotainment to autonomous driving."

## Session Summary
The race to roll out new technology features, mobility services and autonomous vehicles continues to heat up across the tech and automotive industries. Over the past year, we’ve seen a flurry of M&A activity, partnerships and new alliances, as automakers and their suppliers realize that the software and hardware required for autonomous driving is too complex for any one company to develop alone.
While this is a step forward, greater collaboration across the entire industry is needed to accelerate autonomous driving. An open source platform for automakers to share information such as map data, miles driven and scenarios tested could speed up production cycles and decrease time-to-market.
Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) is an open source project that is bringing together more than 100 members across the automotive and tech industries to develop a shared software platform for all in-vehicle applications from infotainment to autonomous driving.
