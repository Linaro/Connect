excerpt: 'Clear governance, a shared understanding of process and rules, is key to
  the success of open source adoption at scale. Our global community represents many
  perspectives, many cultures and many jurisdictions. To address these we have seen
  the emergence of overarching principles, practical guides and effective tools that
  support the necessary balance of flexibility and shared trust. This talk will focus
  in the key open source solutions that address real world challenges. It will highlight
  a stack of solutions that includes OpenChain, SPDX, Reuse.Software, FOSSology, ScanCode,
  sw360 and QuarterMaster and explain how they work together from meta level (e.g
  OpenChain standard) to practical process implementation (e.g QuarterMaster CI/CD).


  For the last 10 minutes of Shane''s keynote, Lucien Cheng-hsia Lin will discuss
  License Compliance in Asia.'

Speaker: Shane Coughlan

## Session Summary
Clear governance, a shared understanding of process and rules, is key to the success of open source adoption at scale. Our global community represents many perspectives, many cultures and many jurisdictions. To address these we have seen the emergence of overarching principles, practical guides and effective tools that support the necessary balance of flexibility and shared trust. This talk will focus in the key open source solutions that address real world challenges. It will highlight a stack of solutions that includes OpenChain, SPDX, Reuse.Software, FOSSology, ScanCode, sw360 and QuarterMaster and explain how they work together from meta level (e.g OpenChain standard) to practical process implementation (e.g QuarterMaster CI/CD).

For the last 10 minutes of Shane's keynote, Lucien Cheng-hsia Lin will discuss License Compliance in Asia.
