excerpt: Linaro created the Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT) framework as a service
  capable of functional testing the Linux kernel under a full userspace image (e.g.,
  OpenEmbedded and AOSP), on a variety of hardware and selectively reporting the results
  upstream (or to anyone who wants them) when regressions are detected. The purpose
  of this presentation is to describe Remote LKFT Labs which is a proposal to extend
  the reach of Linux kernel functional testing to Linaro member SoCs in a way that
  can accommodate privacy/confidentiality concerns of members as well as address device
  complexity concerns of Linaro engineers. This presentation will describe the proposed
  capabilities, deficiencies, and compelling arguments for adoption of remote LKFT
  labs by Linaro members.
