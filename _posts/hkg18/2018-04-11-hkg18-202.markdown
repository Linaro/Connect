excerpt: 'We propose to improve auto-vectorization in GCC by facilitating examination
  of related GIMPLE statements in a loop together and utilizing the information so
  derived to transform the computations in two orthogonal ways: (a) We propose an
  alternative mechanism to implement SLP by coalescsing ASTs of independent computations.
  (b) We try to decide where and which permutations should be effected based on the
  knowledge of the available target instructions.'

## Session Summary
We propose to improve auto-vectorization in GCC by facilitating examination of related GIMPLE statements in a loop together and utilizing the information so derived to transform the computations in two orthogonal ways: (a) We propose an alternative mechanism to implement SLP by coalescsing ASTs of independent computations. (b) We try to decide where and which permutations should be effected based on the knowledge of the available target instructions.
