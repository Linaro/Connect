excerpt: ODP is designed as an abstraction layer for hardware accelerators for SoCs.
  Many of these SoC vendors also support DPDK. DPDK has been embraced by the wider
  networking community. However, there are key fundamental differences between ODP
  and DPDK. One of the primary difference being the packet format. There are also
  differences in implementations of features like scheduler which might not suite
  all the available Arm platforms. This presentation aims to explore the current differences
  between ODP and DPDK.
