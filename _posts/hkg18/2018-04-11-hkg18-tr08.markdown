excerpt: Arm's Scalable Vector Extensions is an innovative solution to processing
  highly data parallel workloads. While several out-of-tree attempts at implementing
  SVE support for QEMU existed, we took a fundamentally different approach to solving
  key challenges and therefore pursued a from-scratch QEMU SVE implementation in Linaro.
  Our strategic choice was driven by several factors. First as an "upstream first"
  organisation we were focused on a solution that would be readily accepted by the
  upstream project. This entailed doing our development in the open on the project
  mailing lists where early feedback and community consensus can be reached.

## Session Summary
Arm's Scalable Vector Extensions is an innovative solution to processing highly data parallel workloads. While several out-of-tree attempts at implementing SVE support for QEMU existed, we took a fundamentally different approach to solving key challenges and therefore pursued a from-scratch QEMU SVE implementation in Linaro. Our strategic choice was driven by several factors. First as an "upstream first" organisation we were focused on a solution that would be readily accepted by the upstream project. This entailed doing our development in the open on the project mailing lists where early feedback and community consensus can be reached.
