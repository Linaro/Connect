excerpt:
  The LAVA on your desk BoF is aimed at individual kernel engineers, subsystem
  maintainers and other interested individuals who have a single device attached to
  their development box and who want to be able to triage results coming out of LKFT
  and other systems based on LAVA by re-running LKFT test jobs with their own patched
  kernel tree etc. The hardware for this use case does not have to cope with dozens
  of devices or automated submissions. It is the single-device-single-developer model
  and the cost of the hardware can reflect this.
