excerpt: Experience with automation of test devices in Linaro extends over seven years,
  millions of test jobs, using over one hundred different types of devices, Arm, x86
  and emulated. Varied primary boot methods have been used alone or in combination,
  including U-Boot, UEFI, Fastboot, IoT, PXE. The Linaro lab itself has supported
  over 150 devices, covering more than 40 different device types. There are a range
  of issues with automating new hardware and the experience of the LAVA lab and software
  teams has highlighted areas where decisions at the hardware design stage have delayed
  deployment of automation or made the task of triage of automation failures much
  harder than necessary. This session is a summary of our experience with background
  and examples. The aim is to provide background information about why common failures
  occur, and recommendations on how to design hardware and firmware to reduce problems
  in the future. We describe some device design features as hard requirements to enable
  successful automation, and some which are guaranteed to block automation.
