excerpt: For numerical calculation programs on supercomputers, the kernel part occupies
  80% or more of the execution time in many cases. Therefore, the quality of the code
  generated by the compiler for these kernel parts is significant. We created a tool,
  which is called HCQC, to aid in the investigation of the quality of the code generated
  by the compiler for the kernel part. In this presentation, we report the details
  of HCQC and the results of evaluating the quality of GCC and LLVM when compiling
  the kernel part of benchmark programs using HCQC.

## Session Summary
For numerical calculation programs on supercomputers, the kernel part occupies 80% or more of the execution time in many cases. Therefore, the quality of the code generated by the compiler for these kernel parts is significant. We created a tool, which is called HCQC, to aid in the investigation of the quality of the code generated by the compiler for the kernel part. In this presentation, we report the details of HCQC and the results of evaluating the quality of GCC and LLVM when compiling the kernel part of benchmark programs using HCQC.
