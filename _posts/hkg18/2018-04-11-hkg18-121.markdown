excerpt: The presentation will show a reference design of containerized VNFs with
  VPP integration on Arm-based NFV infrastructure. Kubernetes is used as VIM to deploy
  Docker cluster for OPNFV platform. DPDK is used to accelerate containerized VNFs,
  meanwhile, the VPP vhost-user interfaces are used to create L2 bridge and VxLAN
  overlay to connect between containers, which can be on the same host or different
  hosts. The design ensures high throughput performance for VNFs, as well as provides
  high scalability. This presentation will be useful for audience who want to understand
  the progress of NFV on Arm and who have plan to deploy their containerized NFV solutions
  on Arm architecture.
