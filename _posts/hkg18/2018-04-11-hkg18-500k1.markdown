## Session Summary
For decades we have been able to take advantage of Moore’s Law to improve single thread performance, reduce power and cost with each generation of semiconductor technology. While technology has advanced after the end of Dennard scaling more than 10 years ago, the advances have slowed down. Server performance increases have relied on increasing core counts and power budgets.
At the same time, workloads have changed in the era of cloud computing. Scale out is becoming more important than scale up. Domain specific architectures have started to emerge to improve the energy efficiency of emerging workloads like deep learning
This talk will provide a historical perspective and discuss emerging trends driving the development of modern servers processors.
