excerpt: As well as a compiler, a major output of the LLVM project are the Clang developer
  tools and libclang. In this presentation we will take a look at how to use these
  tools in your C/C++ project regardless of whether you use clang as your compiler.
  We'll cover tools such as clang-format, clang-tidy and clang-check, with a look
  at how you can use the python bindings to libclang to build your own custom tool.
