excerpt: Current hardware set on AI application have been dominated by GPGPU. We see
  this trend very natural since "LEARNING" which requires processing power was the
  start point. Now we are in the phase to utilize the "DATA" for inference. Attaching
  CNN dedicated processing accelerator into Socionext SynQuacer server becomes AI
  server with superior power efficiency to existing hardware set. The scalability
  of this AI server will make AI inference process similar to Index searching.

## Session Summary
Current hardware set on AI application have been dominated by GPGPU. We see this trend very natural since "LEARNING" which requires processing power was the start point. Now we are in the phase to utilize the "DATA" for inference. Attaching CNN dedicated processing accelerator into Socionext SynQuacer server becomes AI server with superior power efficiency to existing hardware set. The scalability of this AI server will make AI inference process similar to Index searching.
