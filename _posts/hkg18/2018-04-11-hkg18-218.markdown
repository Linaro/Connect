excerpt:
  "With LoRa gaining more traction in recent times and seeing LoRa gateways
  being based on Linux one could wonder why there is no work on integrating the LoRa
  layers into the Linux networking stack directly. To make use of its solid protocol
  stacks and constant improvements and innovations. Solutions where the data coming
  from LoRa is just piped in over a SLIP connection do not allow the tight integration
  with the tools available for Linux networking which would surely benefit a LoRa
  gateway. With netfilter, traffic control and eBPF just naming a few. The idea branched
  of the linux-wpan project to see if there is a bigger interest in having a LoRa
  subsystem in the Linux kernel. Some initial brainstorming has been done but without
  enough interest it is unclear if we should step forward with such a project. Items
  for discussion would include: o LPWAN on Linux o Gateway and powered node use case
  o PHY/MAC layer and LoRaWAN o Share code with existing subsystems where possible
  (link layer security with ieee802154, 6lowpan) o 1 transceiver driver already posted
  o A few people already showed interest, more people around here? o Project setup
  (vger mailing list, patchwork, github, korg tree hosting, etc)"

## Session Summary

## With LoRa gaining more traction in recent times and seeing LoRa gateways being based on Linux one could wonder why there is no work on integrating the LoRa layers into the Linux networking stack directly. To make use of its solid protocol stacks and constant improvements and innovations. Solutions where the data coming from LoRa is just piped in over a SLIP connection do not allow the tight integration with the tools available for Linux networking which would surely benefit a LoRa gateway. With netfilter, traffic control and eBPF just naming a few. The idea branched of the linux-wpan project to see if there is a bigger interest in having a LoRa subsystem in the Linux kernel. Some initial brainstorming has been done but without enough interest it is unclear if we should step forward with such a project. Items for discussion would include: o LPWAN on Linux o Gateway and powered node use case o PHY/MAC layer and LoRaWAN o Share code with existing subsystems where possible (link layer security with ieee802154, 6lowpan) o 1 transceiver driver already posted o A few people already showed interest, more people around here? o Project setup (vger mailing list, patchwork, github, korg tree hosting, etc)
