excerpt: In this session we will explain all the work the Software Defined Infrastructure
  team has gone through to make OpenStack run as it does today on Aarch64. We will
  talk about the good, the bad and the ugly with emphasis on our experience working
  with OpenStack upstream and setting up CI on Arm. We went from being outsiders to
  being part of the project almost without realising, and the journey has been filled
  with evangelization and engineers amazed at the fact that Aarch64 is ready to run
  infrastructure software such as OpenStack.
