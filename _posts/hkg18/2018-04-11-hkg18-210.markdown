excerpt: The Android Open Source Project has integrated the Energy Aware Scheduler.
  In this context, it is important we continue the process of identifying the bottleneck
  in the kernel and optimize the scheduler. However the power management covers different
  areas and the scheduler may compete in the decisions for optimum energy saving /
  performance trade-off. We need to identify those conflicting interactions and improve
  the collaboration between the PM subsystems and the scheduler.

## Session Summary
The Android Open Source Project has integrated the Energy Aware Scheduler. In this context, it is important we continue the process of identifying the bottleneck in the kernel and optimize the scheduler. However the power management covers different areas and the scheduler may compete in the decisions for optimum energy saving / performance trade-off. We need to identify those conflicting interactions and improve the collaboration between the PM subsystems and the scheduler.
