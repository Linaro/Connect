excerpt: User space I/O offers significant speedup potential for data plane and other
  high-performance applications, but at the high cost of writing and maintaining separate
  device drivers. Building on the existing kernel mediated device framework originally
  introduced to support GPUs, net_mdev extends this support to network I/O, requiring
  only minor changes to existing kernel drivers. Applications, in turn, need only
  provide "mini drivers" to handle the performance I/O paths in user space while leaving
  control operations in the kernel.

## Session Summary
User space I/O offers significant speedup potential for data plane and other high-performance applications, but at the high cost of writing and maintaining separate device drivers. Building on the existing kernel mediated device framework originally introduced to support GPUs, net_mdev extends this support to network I/O, requiring only minor changes to existing kernel drivers. Applications, in turn, need only provide "mini drivers" to handle the performance I/O paths in user space while leaving control operations in the kernel.
