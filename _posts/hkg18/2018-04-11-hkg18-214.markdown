excerpt: As a Common Accelerator Framework for User Space Applications was brought
  up at last Connect SFO 2017 by Kenneth Lee, we have done a series of work to support
  user applications better. DMA mapping for accelerators in multiple processes and
  SVM(Share Virtual Memory) without page fault are running okay on our D06 board,
  which is enabled by new VFIO and IOMMU APIs based on the SVM patch (RFC v3) from
  Jean-Philippe Brucker of Arm. Also, we do some performance testing on the above
  scenarios with our SOC device (ZIP) to show the advantages of Wrapdrive.In the next,
  SVM with page fault from devices will be supported by Wrapdrive with a high performance
  and smart coding way.

## Session Summary
As a Common Accelerator Framework for User Space Applications was brought up at last Connect SFO 2017 by Kenneth Lee, we have done a series of work to support user applications better. DMA mapping for accelerators in multiple processes and SVM(Share Virtual Memory) without page fault are running okay on our D06 board, which is enabled by new VFIO and IOMMU APIs based on the SVM patch (RFC v3) from Jean-Philippe Brucker of Arm. Also, we do some performance testing on the above scenarios with our SOC device (ZIP) to show the advantages of Wrapdrive.In the next, SVM with page fault from devices will be supported by Wrapdrive with a high performance and smart coding way.
