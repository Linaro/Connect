excerpt: In this presentation we will talk about Android Verified Boot 2.0 and how
  it's used in a transparent integrity checking of Android partitions, also provide
  some highlights about current progress of AVB 2.0 integration with U-boot and Trustzone.
  In this case Trustzone plays a vital role here in making this setup tamper-proof,
  particularly improving rollback protection. It will do that by leverage the TEE
  itself as well as the RPMB partition in eMMC.
