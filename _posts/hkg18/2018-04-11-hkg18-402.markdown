excerpt: The session presents an initiative to build secure key management services
  in the OP-TEE project. Based on OP-TEE services (persistent storage, cryptography,
  time, etc) one could build a trusted application of store and use secure keys. An
  open source implementation for generic key services could be of interest. However
  there are many client APIs defined in the ecosystem which is a matter of concern
  for standardization of such services. The session will open a discussion on this
  and presents the current choice of the PKCS#11 Cryptoki. There can be lot of key
  attributes and cryptographic schemes to be supported. The session will present the
  current plans (starting from AES flavors) and what is currently missing in the OP-TEE
  (as certificate support, bootloader support). This session aims at getting feedback
  from the community on this topic, discuss about expected services and client APIs.
