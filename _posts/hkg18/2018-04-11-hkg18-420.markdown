excerpt:
  Device-tree overlay feature allows for runtime modification of flattened
  device-tree. Its useful when device configuration can be fully determined only at
  runtime. Overlay involves merging number of overlay blobs into a base blob after
  fixing local and external phandle references found in overlay blobs. This discussion
  will focus on extending overlay feature to allow an overlay blob to be overlaid
  on another overlay blob, which means that some of the external reference found in
  overlay blob may not be resolved from the base (overlay) blob. This is useful to
  maintain device-tree source code in multiple repositories and merge their binary
  forms together during build.

## Session Summary

## Device-tree overlay feature allows for runtime modification of flattened device-tree. Its useful when device configuration can be fully determined only at runtime. Overlay involves merging number of overlay blobs into a base blob after fixing local and external phandle references found in overlay blobs. This discussion will focus on extending overlay feature to allow an overlay blob to be overlaid on another overlay blob, which means that some of the external reference found in overlay blob may not be resolved from the base (overlay) blob. This is useful to maintain device-tree source code in multiple repositories and merge their binary forms together during build.
