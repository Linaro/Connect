excerpt: Devicetree has become the dominant hardware configuration language used when
  building embedded systems. Projects using Devicetree now include Linux, U-Boot,
  Android, FreeBSD, and Zephyr. However, it is notoriously difficult to write correct
  Devicetree data files. The dtc tools perform limited tests for valid data, and there
  there is not yet a way to add validity test for specific hardware descriptions.
  Neither is there a good way to document requirements for specific bindings. Work
  is underway to solve these problems. This session will present a proposal for adding
  Devicetree schema files to the Devicetree toolchain that can be used to both validate
  data and produce usable documentation.

## Session Summary
Devicetree has become the dominant hardware configuration language used when building embedded systems. Projects using Devicetree now include Linux, U-Boot, Android, FreeBSD, and Zephyr. However, it is notoriously difficult to write correct Devicetree data files. The dtc tools perform limited tests for valid data, and there there is not yet a way to add validity test for specific hardware descriptions. Neither is there a good way to document requirements for specific bindings. Work is underway to solve these problems. This session will present a proposal for adding Devicetree schema files to the Devicetree toolchain that can be used to both validate data and produce usable documentation.
