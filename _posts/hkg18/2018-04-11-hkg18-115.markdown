excerpt: The open source hypervisor Jailhouse provides hard partitioning of multicore
  systems to co-locate multiple Linux or RTOS instances side by side. It aims at low
  complexity and minimal footprint to achieve deterministic behavior and enable certifications
  according to safety or security standards. In this session, we would like to look
  at the Arm-specific status of Jailhouse and discuss applications, to-dos and possible
  collaborations around it with the Arm community. The session is intended to be half
  presentation, half Q&A / discussion.

## Session Summary
The open source hypervisor Jailhouse provides hard partitioning of multicore systems to co-locate multiple Linux or RTOS instances side by side. It aims at low complexity and minimal footprint to achieve deterministic behavior and enable certifications according to safety or security standards. In this session, we would like to look at the Arm-specific status of Jailhouse and discuss applications, to-dos and possible collaborations around it with the Arm community. The session is intended to be half presentation, half Q&A; / discussion.
