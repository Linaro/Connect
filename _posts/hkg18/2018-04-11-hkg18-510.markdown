excerpt: 'OpenStack is the number 1 private cloud Open Source project and Container
  technology is the heart of micro service. Zun is the Container Management service
  in OpenStack, supporting multi-arch including both AArch64 and X86, which provides
  the foundation of running container as a service in private cloud. We''ve introduced
  the Capsule (the cabins) as a container group that allows all the containers within
  the group to share the same resources, so that the capsule can be scheduled as a
  co-work unit, improving the flexibility of running container in cloud - flying cabins
  in the cloud. I will introduce the container capsule design, basic work process
  and why it is an important project for AArch64 in data center, I''ll also make a
  comparison between Zun and other container technology. The take away for audience:
  they will understand some key cloud computing and container orchestration technologies
  and get a deep understanding about the micro service backend, cloud computing framework
  and prototype structure, and why they are critical for Arm in the cloud computing
  domain.'

## Session Summary
OpenStack is the number 1 private cloud Open Source project and Container technology is the heart of micro service. Zun is the Container Management service in OpenStack, supporting multi-arch including both AArch64 and X86, which provides the foundation of running container as a service in private cloud. We've introduced the Capsule (the cabins) as a container group that allows all the containers within the group to share the same resources, so that the capsule can be scheduled as a co-work unit, improving the flexibility of running container in cloud - flying cabins in the cloud. I will introduce the container capsule design, basic work process and why it is an important project for AArch64 in data center, I'll also make a comparison between Zun and other container technology. The take away for audience: they will understand some key cloud computing and container orchestration technologies and get a deep understanding about the micro service backend, cloud computing framework and prototype structure, and why they are critical for Arm in the cloud computing domain.
