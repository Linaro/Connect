excerpt:
  "The last decade or so of development in open source hardware, software and
  data has brought an astonishing richness of resources for artists: Python and C++
  libraries for natural language processing, biological simulation, data programming
  and machine learning - such as TensorFlow, NLTK, openFrameworks and project Gutenberg.  As
  well as continually expanding functionality, increased accessibility has drastically
  brought down the barriers to entry and exploration."
