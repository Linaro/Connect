Everyone knows the importance of validation and automated testing in software development cycle but it often means complex software and hardware setup, especially for individual people. This session is a case study reviewing my work to create a mini LAVA lab for my home office. The main goal for this lab being to perform automated wireless feature testing on 96Boards devices while keeping the instance simple, reproducible, autonomous, compact, low-cost and fully running on Arm. I will discuss the design choices such as containerization using docker, the different problems I met and also how a well defined hardware standard like 96Boards helped me to achieve my goal.
