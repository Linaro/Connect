  Rust safety and concurrency themed language - Now also on Arm!'
---

Rust is a modern systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications. In this presentation we present the history, intent and design of Redox OS. We will discuss the benefit of using Rust for writing an OS, Redox's security model and finally an overview of the work done for porting Redox to Arm.
