At Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018, [http://foundries.io](http://foundries.io) and Toradex discuss Linux microPlatform, what microPlatform is and how it helps Toradex to build their next generation Software Platform.

Linux microPlatform is an open source, minimal, secure, updatable Operating System based on OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project. Toradex ports the microPlatform to its Arm-based System on Modules and it uses it as the basis for its future Software Planform called Torizon.

Linux microPlatform modularized the embedded software stack utilizing Docker Containers, and so it provides a robust and simple to update platform. It includes a secure Uptane-compliant over-the-air update solution using OSTree.

Founderies.io provides continuous updates to Linux microPlatform, as they believe the latest software is the most secure software.

Toradex also elaborates on its plans to simplify developersâ€™ lives with its Torizon platform leveraging Linux microPlatforms, such as simplifying application development, enabling a modern DevOps workflow and easing migration from Windows-based systems.
