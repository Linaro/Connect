UC San Diego Professor Thomas Bewley discusses his Segway-like educational robotics kit, eduMIP, based on the BeagleBone Blue at Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018. This inexpensive kit (available online, for $128, at Renaissance Robotics [https://www.renaissancerobotics.com/e...](https%3A%2F%2Fwww.renaissancerobotics.com%2FeduMIP.html&redir_token=sc8xdR1xYUHXOReiBSH3w7pXuMt8MTU0MjM3NTEzNUAxNTQyMjg4NzM1&v=4nzdzDoDF_A&event=video_description)) is used in his Embedded Control & Robotics course at UCSD, which Prof Bewley is currently working on taking online as a MOOC. It is also beginning to be used by a community of researchers and educators at other universities around the world. In this video, Prof Bewley also introduces his early efforts in developing new (and, significantly higher-power) motor-control daughterboards in the 96boards and Raspberry Pi formats. He also discusses eduMIP v.2 and some other advanced prototypes in his lab, as well as the Robot Control (RC) software library that drives this hardware, and will ultimately enable easy porting of control codes across the BeagleBone, Raspberry Pi, and 96boards linux-based product lines, in addition to deployment onto very-low-cost custom targets based on Cortex M based processors running an RTOS. His ultimate goal with this ambitious effort is to facilitate a much more seamless pathway from lab prototype to commercial product.
