MRAA ([https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa](https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fintel-iot-devkit%2Fmraa)) is a low level skeleton library for Linux based systems which provides userspace access to the peripherals on 96Boards Consumer Edition boards using multiple interfaces such as C, C++, Python, Java and Javascript. Mani, being the Co-Maintainer of this library, talks about the history of how 96Boards started using this library instead of their legacy 96BoardsGPIO library. Also, he explains how the MRAA library serves well for them to handle multiple 96Boards with different SoCs which no other platform is doing.
