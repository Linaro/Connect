Open Source Academics (OSA) by 96Boards ([https://github.com/osacademics](https://github.com/osacademics)) aims to facilitate and expand the educational experience on a global stage by providing scalable curriculum and standardized course materials through an open source platform. To fully understand the diverse nature of OSA, this summary will be broken down into seven discrete sections: Motivation, Mission, Platform, Stakeholders, Infinity Committee, Incentives and Roadmap.

OSA wants to unite industry and academia to create, and host a fully functional and open sourced educational platform which facilitates consumption and contribution of standardized educational curriculum and incentivized course materials on a global scale (with a current focus on STEAM content). OSA will work with stakeholders to achieve a balanced set of standards and incentives which encourage collaboration and drive content quality and growth.
