title: 'YVR18-302:EB corbos and the L4Re microhypervisor: Open-Source Automotive Safety'
---

Autonomous driving, Car-to-X connectivity and new vehicle E/E architectures are driving demand for increasing compute capacity and software complexity in vehicles.  This complexity is at odds with the safety and security requirements.  A promising approach for tackling these challenges is software isolation using a trusted hypervisor that is fit for automotive certification.

Kernkonzept and Elektrobit are building on the open-source L4Re microkernel to create such a trusted and safety-certified hypervisor.  It is part of Elektrobit's EB corbos automotive software suite and integrates with Elektrobit's Linux and Adaptive Autosar solutions, as well as with established open-source automotive and Linaro ecosystems.
