The Arm Architecture is continually evolving as new features and enhancements are developed to meet market demand. Arm, Linaro, and the wider ecosystem build on the foundations of the Architecture, creating a rich and varied range of products along with associated Firmware and Software, driving the technology of the future.

This presentation will include details of the iterative functionality Arm has been developing in 2018.  It will discuss the software enablement that has been going on, and the future development needs of the wider ecosystem, to ensure that software is available when physical products are delivered.
