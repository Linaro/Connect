[To be rescheduled] Significant progress has been made in various software components such are SDEI, SPM, StandaloneMM and APEI driver that are required to put together support for RAS error injection and error handling on enterprise platforms. This proposal for presentation takes a deep dive on the technical details of integrating these components to create an end-to-end RAS solution with emphasis on details about error injection, firmware-first error handling methodology, CPER record creation and notifying linux using SDEI interface about the RAS events for further processing. Armâ€™s SGI-575 FVP platform is the first to create this solution and audience can gain insights into the technical details and challenges of enabling this solution for other platforms.
