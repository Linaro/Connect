Discussion on design principles and challenges in implementing a fully open source continuous integration system. The CI needs to able test and verify, two or more binaries, of different privilege levels, while ensuring correct functional behavior and compliance. It needs to be able to provide seamless integration with existing back-ends such as Travis/Jenkins and allow the users to locally test their code, using simulation environment. The design should be standardized and provide guidelines and hook requirements for board manufacturers, aspiring to produce a CI friendly, easy to integrate with Lava hardware.
