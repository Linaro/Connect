On some hardware with multiple clocksources, we have coarse grained clocksources that support the CLOCK_SOURCE_SUSPEND_NONSTOP flag, but which are less than ideal for timekeeping whereas other clocksources can be better candidates but halt on suspend.

Currently, the timekeeping core only supports timing suspend using CLOCK_SOURCE_SUSPEND_NONSTOP clocksources if that clocksource is the current clocksource for timekeeping.

As a result, some architectures try to implement read_persistent_clock64() using those non-stop clocksources, but isn't really ideal, which will introduce more duplicate code. To fix this, provide logic to allow a registered SUSPEND_NONSTOP clocksource, which isn't the current clocksource, to be used to calculate the suspend time.
