- biography: '"David helped found Linaro and is its CTO.  He chairs the Technical
    Steering Committee.  This suits his love of open source and new technologies.  He
    is a self confessed gadget freak and first adopter of technology (so long as it
    has an Arm processor or two in it).  His role models are Professor Branestawm
    and Dr. Emmett Brown.


    When not being CTO, David likes to hike, take photographs and relax listening
    to and playing (although not well) music.  Good wine and friends make for a relaxing
    time."'
