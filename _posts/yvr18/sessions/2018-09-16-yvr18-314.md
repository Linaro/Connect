Toradex is an embedded module provider. We plan to adopt containers as a main architectural component for future product offerings. Using LMP (Linux microPlatforms) as a starting point this presentation will be about experience and challenges we see in using containers in embedded. This discussion should be about sharing experience and discussion possible paths to ease the use of containers in embedded.
