Rook is an open source project hosted by CNCF to orchestrate the distributed storage system such as Ceph with cloud native primitives. In this presentation, Dennis will first introduce the overall design idea of the Rook and how it works, after that he will talk about how to deploy a Ceph cluster automatically with help of Rook and take use of it, including the volume provisioning and attachment, against a real workload on AArch64 server. At last, some new features(eg. CSI support), challenges and issues of this project will also be discussed.
