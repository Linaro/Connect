title: YVR18-501:Using VPN implementation from upstream kernel in Android
youtube_video_url: None
tag: session
---

Till now Android is using its own L2TP/PPTP protocols implementation from Android kernel. The same functionality is available in upstream kernel. In order to make Android kernel closer to upstream kernel, we want to get rid that implementation from Android kernel and re-use the one from upstream kernel. Some work was done in AOSP to make it possible. During this session we will review how VPN works in AOSP system components, and how we switched to use upstream L2TP/PPTP.
