Autoware is becoming a common software platform for research and development of autonomous driving technology. So many prototypes of autonomous vehicles are built on top of Autoware. In this talk, a new profile of Autoware is presented, which moves forward with automotive-oriented specification of embedded boards. In particular, Autoware is now available with the 96Boards products, enabling new prototypes of autonomous vehicles with low-power platforms. Beyond the core modules of Autoware, useful open tools, utilities, and services to enrich Autoware are also presented, such as mapping and machine learning. Finally, the roadmap for Autoware towards the post 2020 era is provided, and this talk is concluded with introduction of autonomous vehicles powered by Autoware.
