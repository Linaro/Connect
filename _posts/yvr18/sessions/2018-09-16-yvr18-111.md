Recent patches have tried to address the reader-writer concurrency in rte_hash library. However, these fall short on solving the problem on multiple use cases. These solutions result in further significant problems when the use cases involve preemptible writer threads. Lock free addition and deletion algorithms are required to truly solve the read-write concurrency. This talk explores the need for lock-free algorithms in the context of rte_hash library, the changes required in rte_hash for 64bit systems. It will also discuss various options available for solving the issue on 32bit systems and seek feedback. Performance numbers with this proposal will also be presented.
