Open Source Academics (OSA) aims to facilitate and expand the educational experience on a global stage by providing scalable curriculum and standardized course materials through an open source platform. The initiative intends to bridge the often growing gap between industry and academia. To fully explain the diverse nature of OSA, this presentation will cover seven discrete topics:

- Motivation
- Mission
- Platform
- Who are the Stakeholders?
- The Infinity Committee
- Incentives, Deliverables and ROI
- Roadmap.

Other 96Boards initiatives will be covered in brief, questions and open discussion are welcome.
