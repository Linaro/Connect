- biography: "\"GNU compiler engineer at Arm for 4 years working on the GNU Arm embedded
    toolchain for R and M profile Arm architectures. Recently joined Linaro as an
    assignee working on LLVM. Before Arm I did a PhD on multi-core programming.\n\nBeside
    work I enjoy movie watching, cycling on occasion and am involved in Debian as
    a Debian Developer. However I don\u2019t have much time for these these days as
    I became a father 8 months ago of my adorable son Hugo. I am originally from France
    but now live in Cambridge (UK) after having lived 2 years and a half in Shanghai.\""
