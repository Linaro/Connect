2017 saw the release of the first version of the MCUboot project.
This bootloader seeks to be a collaborative effort to solve the issues
of securely booting and upgrading embedded (IoT) systems.  Due to
increasing security requirements, these embedded systems are becoming
more complex, often involving multiple CPUs or multiple security
domains within a single processor.  In this presentation, David Brown
will review the current status of the MCUboot project, and cover the
work being done to support multiple image update.  This will include
the project's involvement with the IETF's Software Update for IoT
(SUIT) working group.
