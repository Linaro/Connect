- biography: '"I am a software engineer working at Intel''s OTC(Open Source Technology
    Center) for the last 3 years. I am involved in developing/optimizing software
    which enables new features/instructions specific to Intel processors on the mainline
    Linux kernel. I am also currently the maintainer of the LUV(Linux UEFI Validation)
    project which mainly validates the interoperability of UEFI firmware with Linux.

    I earlier this year gave a talk at the Embedded Linux conference."'

This presentation will give an overview of the Linux UEFI Validation (LUV) project; its motivations and objectives. LUV creates a Linux validation OS which can be used by Linux kernel developers and firmware engineers alike to reduce the development and enabling time of Linux on UEFI systems. It is an architecture-agnostic, automated framework consisting of several open-source test-suites packaged into a cohesive and easy-to-use product. It aims to help uncover bugs in the implementation of UEFI firmware and Linux kernel thereby improving the quality of the interaction between the UEFI firmware and the Linux kernel.
