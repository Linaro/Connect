This session is a gathering of all of those interested in SQUAD, which is the application that powers qa-reports.linaro.org. SQUAD is being developed in the open since day 0, and even with no to little marketing effort, it's already used by other organizations. Points to discuss are future directions, how to attract more contributors, and how to best collaborate to support the different needs of its users.
