Device ID in U-Boot and Linux can sometime get out of sync, this has happened on the Poplar board
OP-TEE uses hardcoded CFG_RPMB_FS_DEV_ID to select RPMB device and this is a problem if Linux and U-boot disagrees on the number
How can this be solved?
Make Linux and U-boot agree?
Let tee-supplicant interpret the ID and route it to the correct device?
