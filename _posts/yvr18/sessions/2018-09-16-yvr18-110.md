MMWG's OE builds serve two goals: to provide the baseline for linux development in MMWG, and to present the results of MMWG's work to the others.
The topics to be covered:
- build set-up, the OE layers by MMWG used in these builds, pre-built images published at snapshots.linaro.org
- the challenges in integrating machine-specific support for features like OP-TEE
- integrating Linaro OpenCDM into the builds; MMWG experience with browsers used to test OpenCDM with (Chromium, WPE browser)
- testing: from jenkins builds to testing in LAVA and displaying the results at qa-reports.linaro.org. What we need to improve to get more value from tests.
