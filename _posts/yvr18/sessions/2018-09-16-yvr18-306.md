In this session we will present the DDS Security library project: an open source library that isolates the DDS security operations and key management under a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This approach uses Arm security hardware (TrustZoneâ„¢) to secure communication between discrete components within the fabric of autonomous machines - Automotive, Robotics, Drones etc. whilst keeping secure assets (e.g. keys) protected. The presentation will focus on the OP-TEE backend, its operation and enablement into eProsima's Fast-RTPS DDS library implementation to provide a readily available secure stack on an Arm based systems on projects like the Robotic Operating System (ROS).
