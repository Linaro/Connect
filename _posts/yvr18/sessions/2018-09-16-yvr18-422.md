It is often assumed that tiny IoT systems are too limited to run Linux, and a small operating systems like Zephyr is a better choice. However, using a small OS means tradeoffs on functionality, and sometimes Linux would be a better fit. Some devices have enough resources that Linux is feasable if we can get the footprint down. This presentation will talk about a new project that takes the tiny Linux work already done and uses it to build an IoT device frameworks that runs on an small platform with limited ram and XIP flash.
