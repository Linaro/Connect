Introduction to Linaroâ€™s Linux Kernel Functional Test (LKFT) framework, which performs functional regression testing on upstream Linux kernels. Thousands of tests are run across a variety of boards, architectures, and user-space operating systems. Regressions are detected, triaged, and reported upstream as quickly as possible.
This presentation will cover the current status of LKFT, how it benefits the community, and where it is focused going forward.
