Security Working Group has been working with a couple of interesting features the last couple of months. In this presentation we would like to give a short introduction and updates to a couple of different topics, like Android Verified Boot 2.0, TEE support from U-Boot, dynamically linked TA support support in OP-TEE, Buildroot support and PKCS#11 OP-TEE library.
