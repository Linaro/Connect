- biography: >
    I'm a long-time Free and Open Source software developer, and I've
    been hacking on stuff since the mid 90s. Professional history covers the range
    from small embedded machines up to enterprise storage systems, with a healthy
    bit of misc in the middle! On the side, I've worked on all kinds of things in
    the Debian project including being elected Project Leader.

    Now working for Arm, seconded into Linaro to help make Open Source and Arm be
    excellent together.
