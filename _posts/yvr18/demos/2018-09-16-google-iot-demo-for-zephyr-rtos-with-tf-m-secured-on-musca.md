In this demo, the Trusted Firmware M is providing the SPE and JWT sign, Zephyr is providing the NSPE and The Google IoT application is running on Zephyr using secure services from Trusted Firmware M.

- Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is an IoI security framework being developed by Arm.
- Trusted Firmware M (TF-M) is an open source project to provide PSA compliant secure firmware for M profile devices.
- Zephyr is a Linux Foundation Collaboration Project to provide a small, scalable RTOS for connected, resource constrained device.
- Arm Musca-A1 subsystem based on Armv8-M which allows partitioning the SW execution in Secure and Non Secure domain.
