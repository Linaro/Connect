Standard pre-boot environment and boot sequence for embedded platforms, featuring:
- Upstream support in U-Boot
- UEFI ABI
- Firmware-provided system description (DT)
- Boots generic OS images
By standardizing the boot interfacei, platform specific details don't need to be encoded into the OS, and the ABI supports portable pre-boot applications for test and boot control, future work will be on the more standard UEFI featured (e.g. Secure Boot).
