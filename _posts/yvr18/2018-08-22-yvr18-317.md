  The Works on Arm cluster is run by Packet for Arm to provide test, development, and data center CI/CD resources for community projects to build on arm64. The project also includes a weekly video office hours, a weekly newsletter, and a channel on the Packet Community Slack and Freenode IRC (#worksonarm) for community discussion.

  This BOF session will provide current and future users of the cluster an opportunity to discuss technical issues regarding integration, testing, Cloud Native and network workloads, and generally provide a forum for helping set the direction of the effort in the coming year.

  The BOF leader, Ed Vielmetti, is director of the Works on Arm project.
