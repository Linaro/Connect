The Linux kernel has over 26 years of development,  and in that time a rather large number of licenses as well as license header variants have accumulated in it.   Scanners can only guess at what's meant, and usually a significant amount of manual verification work is needed to "clear" the kernel by companies before they can use it in a product.
Last year, the kernel community agreed on using the SPDX ids as a way of moving us towards being able to understand the licensing of the kernel with a "grep".     A brief overview of the state of the kernel licensing cleanup will be presented, as well as tooling available to help.   Discussing the kernel subsystems that Linaro is active in, and any problems with applying the SPDX ids in files,  will be the focus of the remainder of the session.
