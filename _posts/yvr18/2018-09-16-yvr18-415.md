In attempt to provide unified platform for IoT, EDGE networking and Automotive use cases LSS team prepared an OE based build with support for containers and OTA updates. Initial effort was based on using HiKey 6220 as a hardware platform. Other platforms support should be fairly easy to add with OE ‘machine’ abstraction. OTA solution is based on open source components integrated by OpenSourceFoundries. Example use cases were crafted by LSS team mainly for testing purposes. We’re working closely with LEDGE and Automotive teams in order to support the ‘real life’ use cases these teams work on. The presentation aims to present supported features, tested use cases and future plans.
