title: YVR18-316:Validate your personal kernel tree using LKFT
youtube_video_url: None
---

LKFT is run on select upstream Linux branches, but wouldn’t it be great to detect regressions (or fixes) before they reach upstream? Using LKFT’s new Developer Testing tool, kernel engineers can validate their kernel tree using the exact same framework and infrastructure used for upstream releases testing.
This workshop will be an interactive demonstration of this process, its workflow, and its output.
