title: 'YVR18-111: The practice of Contiv/VPP high performance container networking
  solution on Arm platform'
---

Fd.io VPP/DPDK is a high performance virtual switching technology with promising future in Cloud and Edge computing, which provides abundant interfaces and various feature for control and management.  Contiv/VPP is an emerging Kubernetes networking solution that uses FD.io VPP to provide network connectivity between PODs in Kubernetes. 
Contiv/VPP leverages VPP's fast data processing that runs completely in userspace and uses DPDK for fast access to the network IO layer, while mapping the Kubernetes policies into VPP configuration. 
In this presentation, the practice of Contiv/VPP on Arm platform is given with the following list, but not limited to:
1. The core steps for enabling Contiv/VPP on Arm platform
2. The networking model and enhancement for Contiv/VPP on Arm
3. The underlying supporting networking environment adaption of Contiv/VPP on Arm server
4. The typical deployment use case of Contiv/VPP for edge computing on Arm
5. Performance evaluation and comparison for Contiv/VPP with other container networking solutions on Arm
