On 64-bit Arm kernels we currently support up to 48-bits of virtual address space. However, ARMv8.2-LVA introduces the capability to have 52-bit virtual addresses. In this talk I aim to briefly introduce this architectural feature and will then talk through the kernel work so far in exposing this to userspace.
