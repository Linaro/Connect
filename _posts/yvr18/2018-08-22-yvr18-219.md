I will present how NXP Integrated the Linaro OpenCDM plugin into the Chromium Browser, in order to playback Playready content within a Secure Data Path:
- Add support of ION buffer in OpenCDM plugin
- Add ion support in gstreamer
- patch Chromium to support gstreamer
- Patch Microsoft Playready TA to support TEE GP API for crypo operation.
- Add support of Cryptograpic Acceleration (hardware acceleration) to OPTEE
- Add ion support
- Next steps for DRM (WPE support, Widevine support)
