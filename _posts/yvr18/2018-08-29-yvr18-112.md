---

High-core-count systems present some come significant opportunities and challenges for scaling, compared to traditional servers. ARM servers have taken a lead position in this space with some of the highest per-system core counts currently available (and other architectures are poised to follow this lead). This talk is a detailed look at our recent experience scaling up a heavy multimedia conferencing and training system on high-core-count ARM servers, contrasting this with the same scale-up on more traditional legacy systems.
