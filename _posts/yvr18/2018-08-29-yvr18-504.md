  systems'

Hypervisors are becoming increasingly widespread in embedded environments. Their use-case is different from server virtualization, and so are their requirements. The ability to run containerized applications is often a requirement. Xen on ARM is embracing the new challenges with innovative solutions.

This talk will discuss cutting-edge Xen on ARM features for embedded deployments, including dom0less, where multiple domains are started directly by Xen at boot. The presentation will explain the reasons why Xen is an excellent runtime environment for containerized apps and will introduce a new proposal for a Xen Project sub-project to create the ideal platform for secure containers in embedded.
