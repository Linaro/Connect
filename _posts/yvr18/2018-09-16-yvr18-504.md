  boot enabled'

The presentation is sharing the observations and notes from porting and booting Ubuntu Core with secure boot enabled on NXP's i.MX6 SoC. Ubuntu Core is one of the OSes for gateways thus I find it very valuable to share the experience and discuss challenges such as enabling secure boot and dealing with out-of-tree kernel drivers. The main objective is to show the effort required to enable ARM hardware with Ubuntu Core.
