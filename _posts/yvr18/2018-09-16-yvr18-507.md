title: YVR18-507:Maintaining Old ARM Systems
youtube_video_url: None
---

This presentation from one of the ARM kernel contributors will tell you a bit about the old 32 bit ARM systems we are maintaining, when we have deleted systems, when we have modernized them and when we have added totally new systems even though they are technically old or even very old. We will also talk about what ARM systems are actually still out there in the wild and seeing wide deployments and extended life cycles for maintenance.
