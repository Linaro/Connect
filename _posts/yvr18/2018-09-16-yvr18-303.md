Using Xilinx SDSoC and HLS as a model, this presentation, will discuss the merits and abilities of customized hardware accelerators involved with performance aspects of embedded systems.  Using a designed and tested accelerator on the Avnet Ultra96, performance, power, development time metrics will be compared. Through comparing these various metrics, a new path forward for hardware accelerated software designs will be shown as a path forward for the embedded space.  While this is a presentation, the author welcomes discussion!
