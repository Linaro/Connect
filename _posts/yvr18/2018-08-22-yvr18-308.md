title: YVR18-308:Kernel Bugs and Regressions Debugging Best Practices
---

This demo will be based on real work done for real bug cases. It will show some of my best practices in putting together an environment ready for bug resolution: Quick virtual machine cloning, containers, dev boxes, Debian packaging, debug symbols, kernel cross compilation and automation, crash dump generation on different boards,  kdump analysis for both arm32 & arm64, and how to interpret a stack trace and quickly identify possible root cause of the issue.
