This presentation will give an overview of the Linux UEFI Validation (LUV) project; its motivations and objectives. LUV creates a Linux validation OS which can be used by Linux kernel developers and firmware engineers alike to reduce the development and enabling time of Linux on UEFI systems. It is an architecture-agnostic, automated framework consisting of several open-source test-suites packaged into a cohesive and easy-to-use product. It aims to help uncover bugs in the implementation of UEFI firmware and Linux kernel thereby improving the quality of the interaction between the UEFI firmware and the Linux kernel.
