  Although ARM processors are almost always viewed as having been designed for the embedded market, several vendors are making a bet and building server CPUs that contend with Intel in cloud deployments. With the presence of the Java ARM port and a wide variety of applications in the Java ecosystem able to run on ARM CPUs, the real question becomes which workloads are best suited to the ARM servers niche and which metrics can be optimized for using ARM servers.

  This presentation explores the status of Java and the Java ecosystem on ARM, together with the Java ARM port features and performance of specific workloads. Some focus is on the recent changes in the Java ARM port, which the speakerâ€™s company contributes to.
