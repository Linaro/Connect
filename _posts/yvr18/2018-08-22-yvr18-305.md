title: YVR18-305:Getting the best from the Ultra96 in the IoT and Embedded Vision
  Arena without being a FPGA Expert
---

The Ultra96 is unique among 96boards, as it combines ARM cores with programmable logic. To create the most efficient system a high level OS is needed such as Linux however, traditionally Linux developers know little about exploiting programmable logic. This session will introduce how programmers used to developing for embedded Linux can leverage programmable logic without the need to be a programmable logic experts. With a focus on the IoT and embedded Vision / ML
