description: '"I could talk to you all day kernel debugging. Really! In fact I, along
  with my colleague Leo, have spent are large portion of our time recently doing exactly
  that. However I don''t have all day... I have just 25 minutes... and no slides."<br
  /> <br /> In this session Daniel will demonstrate live a some of the ways to exploit
  both static and dynamic tracepoints to study kernel behaviour. We''ll start out
  using just the basic tools available in even tiny busybox distribution before expanding
  our toolkit very slightly by copying a couple of extra binaries onto the system
  under debug.'
