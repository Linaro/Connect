description: This talk introduces a new automated tool to help with development of
  high performance math operations in Go using native assembly instructions. A specific
  case study presented is the optimization of the SHA3 cryptographic hashing function
  in the Go programming language to use ARM NEON vector instructions not currently
  recognized by the Go assembler. This new tool will enable usage of advanced math
  optimization and compilation techniques from C compilers within a Go program natively
  without using cgo. This tool has many possible applications but is primarily targeted
  towards IoT devices for which high performance math operations are needed in a Go
  program on device such as AI/ML, cryptography, data science or signal processing.
