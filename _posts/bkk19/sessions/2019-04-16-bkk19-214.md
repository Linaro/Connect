description: LLVM has reached a sufficient level as a compiler for system programming.<br
  /> However, there are several problems as compilers for HPC applications.<br />
  Therefore, we are improving and enhancing LLVM for HPC.<br /> In this presentation,
  we report our activities on register allocation,<br /> vectorization, and software
  pipelining for AArch 64.<br /> Also, we talk about some optimizations required to
  further<br /> improve the performance of HPC applications.<br />
