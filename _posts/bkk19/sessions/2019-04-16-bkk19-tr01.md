description: Bigtop provides an easy way for user to setup Big Data cloud platform
  and to deploy leading Hadoop-related projects, such as HDFS, Yarn, Mapreduce, and
  Spark.<br /> A lot of commercial distributions are based on bigtop too, such as
  MapR.<br /><br />Plus, since Bigtop 1.3, aarch64 is supported out of the box. No
  special patches are required any more. So, how to use it?<br /> <br /> In this session,
  I will cover the following Bigtop 1.3.0, step-by-step:<br /> * Build Bigtop from
  source (containerized)<br /> * Smoke test with containers<br />* Deploy Bigtop on
  multiple physical machines<br /><br /><br />
