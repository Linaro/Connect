description: '> ne of the challenging tasks of TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) is
  itâ€™s low latency and bounded jitter strict requirements. Although XDP (eXpress Data
  Path) does not offer any jitter guarantees it offers significantly lower latency,
  by offloading traffic off the kernel and directly into user-space sockets (AF_XDP),
  compared to the linux kernel network stack. This talk is about a brief XDP introduction
  and the latency numbers we got on our initial tests.'
