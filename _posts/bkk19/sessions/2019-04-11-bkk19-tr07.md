  EC2 A1 instances are the first EC2 instances powered by Arm-based AWS Graviton processors.
  They deliver significant cost savings for scale-out and Arm-based applications,
  such as web servers, containerized microservices, caching fleets, and distributed
  data stores that are supported by the extensive Arm product platform. In this workshop,
  you learn about EC2 A1 instances and experience how easy it can be to migrate and
  run your workloads on EC2 A1.<br><br><strong>**** Please note that this is a working
