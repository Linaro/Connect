description: In this talk, well walk you through the up-to-date status of Big Data
  on AArch64, especially focus on improvements weve made to support big data components(Hadoop,
  Spark, etc) across platform, the contribution to Apache Bigtop, and the future roadmap.<br><br>Apache
  Bigtop as the open source Hadoop distribution, provides full functionality of packaging,
  testing, and deployment for users to build their own Hadoop Distro from ground up.
  Because of its unique positioning, it is widely leveraged by not only ISVs(Cloudera,
  Hortonworks, Pivotal, ODPi, etc), but also cloud providers(AWE EMR, Google Cloud
  Dataproc). Laying on top of Bigtops foundation, weve pushed the support of big data
  to the next level under the support of Open Data Platform Initiative(ODPi). To breakdown
  the details of this talk, well share about the enhancement of AArch64 support in
  Bigtop, how to run big data on AArch64 with Bigtop Provisioner and Sandbox at a
  click of button, how to build the support of AArch64 with Bigtops docker based architecture,
  and how to test the result with a comprehensive CI coverage. Further more, the newly
  developed integration testing framework 2.0 in Apache Bigtop will be revealed.
