description: During the first Automated Testing Summit [1], developers of some of
  the most popular open source testing projects in the world gathered in Edinburgh
  to discuss how to collaborate and share testing efforts in the future.<br><br>In
  this session, I will first introduce Fuego as a black box and show how Fuego can
  work together with existing testing tools to form a complete CI loop. Next, I will
  show a modularized view of Fuego internals, and explain how specific modules can
  be shared with other testing tools. The talk will be illustrated with examples,
  and will not require previous knowledge on Fuego.&nbsp;<br><br>[1] https://elinux.org/Automated_Testing_Summit
