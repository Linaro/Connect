description: The interrupt prediction is an alternate approach to choose the idle
  state to put the CPU in. However the idle path in the very special place of the
  kernel where it is hard to measure the correctness of the predictions and where
  we have to use a fast algorithm to find out the best idle state to use.<br /> The
  presentation will describe the algorithm to extract the pattern repetitions of an
  interrupt, the mix with the other events and the challenges to measure the timings.
