description: 'There has been a lot of discussion in the ARM community on twitter for
  a NUC like platform for ARM. A group of us have been collecting requirements and
  want to have a discussion with the community at large on what we want ideally see
  in a new platform, ADUC: The Arm Developer Unit of Computing. We''re gathering resources
  and working with industry partners to try and build something to show the world
  that we need something between a Raspberry Pi and a Server that is somewhat easily
  available, and a finished product. Join us to hear what we have found, and provide
  your feedback for what you would want to see in such a product. We won''t solve
  everyone''s problems, but we''re hoping to get something that can be an excellent
  first step.'
