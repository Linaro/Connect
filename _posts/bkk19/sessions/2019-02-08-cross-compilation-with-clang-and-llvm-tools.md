description: '> Clang and the LLVM tools promise to be a drop in replacement for gcc
  and<br /> support cross compilation out of the box. In practice trying to make this
  work<br /> can be a frustrating experience, with little documentation or guidance<br
  /> available.<br /> <br /> This presentation will distil some of the experience
  gained by TCWG, covering:<br /> - Clangs model of cross compilation and how it differs
  from gcc.<br /> - Why there isnt a clang cross-compilation toolchain that I can
  download.<br /> - Building a toolchain based on as many LLVM tools and libraries
  as possible.<br /> - How to use clang when cross compiling with cmake.<br /> - How
  some existing open source projects use clang tools targeting Arm<br /> and AArch64.<br
  /> - Common problems encountered when using clang as a substitute for gcc.'
