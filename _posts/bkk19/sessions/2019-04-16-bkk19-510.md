description: 'DescriptionThis presentation is a report on the last improvements on
  the BFQ I/O scheduler. These improvements benefit virtually any system, from embedded
  devices, to personal systems, to nodes in a data center.<br><br>This first set of
  changes concerns throughput. In the most complex scenarios for guaranteeing I/O
  bandwidths, BFQ delivers up to five-time higher throughput than existing solutions.
  But the same mechanisms that gained BFQ this primacy become a hindrance with some
  deceptive workloads. These workloads trick BFQ mechanisms into wrongly believing
  that some I/O flows need to be privileged with respect to other flows, even at the
  expense of losing throughput dramatically. In contrast, total throughout is the
  only performance parameter that matters. We took countermeasures to offset this
  loss of throughput, countermeasures that fully succeed with some&nbsp;<br>unfriendly
  workloads.<br><br>Then, as for I/O control, the combination of several new improvements
  and fixes let the worst-case start-up time of applications drop by an additional
  35%. We show these results not only through graphs, but also through a new demo
  with a Chromebook.<br><br>The last contributions shown in this presentation are
  about<br>efficiency. In fact, even the execution overhead of an I/O scheduler may
  limit maximum throughput with very fast drives. So, to reduce BFQ overhead, we tried
  to turn some properties of these drives into BFQs advantage: we looked for costly
  optimizations that are no longer necessary with these drives. We found some, and
  added controls that automatically turn them off when not needed.'

- speaker_bio: Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
    University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy. Some of his activities focus on
    scheduling algorithms for transmission links, storage devices, and CPUs. As for
    transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which
    has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+,
    a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Paolo is also the author
    of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler, which seems to be on the right track
    to replace the current default I/O scheduler in Linux. Finally, Paolo has also
    defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD, and
    has provided new theoretic results concerning multiprocessor scheduling. Paolo
    has given about thirty talks, as an invited speaker or to present his scientific
    papers.
