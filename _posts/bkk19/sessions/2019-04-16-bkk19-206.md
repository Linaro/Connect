description: "The HPC segment is in the process of transforming from grid  architectures
  to private and hybrid cloud infrastructures while  customers strive to run with
  maximum performance in their critical HPC  environments. <br />Driven by advanced
  computing technologies commonly found  in big data analytics, AI/Machine learning
  and edge computing, the  modern HPC infrastructure requires new design approaches
  that rely on  having a choice of multiple hardware architectures, availability of
  \ accelerators/GPGPUs and presence of high performance interconnects to  deliver
  highly scalable solutions.<br /> Join us for a panel discussion on how standardization
  and open source  software provide common foundation across all major computing  architectures
  and minimize the impact of future hardware decisions on  user workloads and applications.
  On the panel:<br /> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Yan Fisher (Moderator) - Global Evangelist,
  Red Hat</li>\r\n<li>Mark Hambleton - VP open source software, Arm</li>\r\n<li>Mitsuhisa
  Sato - Deputy Director, RIKEN Center for Computational Science</li>\r\n<li>Jacob
  Smith - Co-founder and CMO, Packet</li>\r\n<li>Rafael Tinoco - HPC Technical Lead,
  Linaro</li>\r\n</ul>"
