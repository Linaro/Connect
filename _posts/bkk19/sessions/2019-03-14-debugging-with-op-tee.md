description: Debugging trusted applications (and OP-TEE itself) can be difficult because,
  for very good reasons, secure software is often reluctant to disclose information
  about its operation to the non-secure world, meaning is does not have access to
  the rich facilities in operating systems such as GNU/Linux that would normally be
  used for system level debug.<br /> <br /> In this session we will discuss the common
  debug techniques used to debug secure applications. We will also look at how it
  is possible to implement function tracing to help solve problems, especially on
  platforms where JTAG debug is unavailable.
