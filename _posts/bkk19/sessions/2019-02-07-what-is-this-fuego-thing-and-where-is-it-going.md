description: Fuego is yet another automated test framework for Linux. But it is different
  from other systems in a few key ways. This session will introduce Fuego and describe
  a few of its features that are different (to Tim's knowledge) from other test systems
  like LAVA, Buildbot, or LTP.<br /> <br /> Some of the features are Fuego's focus
  on individual board testing (rather than test labs), results analysis separated
  from the test itself, and on building a suite of tests readily available to begin
  testing.<br /> <br /> Tim will also share some of his vision for the future of open
  source testing, and what features of Fuego are being prototyped now to move towards
  that vision. (That is, Tim will share his Fuego roadmap.)<br />
