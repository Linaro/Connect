description: Much of the innovation today can be contributed to various forms of open
  source software initiatives. &nbsp;This open source collaboration has produced a
  number of essential open source building blocks used in advanced next generation
  solutions such as machine learning, IoT, and wireless connectivity. However to effectively
  use these open source building blocks, engineering organizations much ensure the
  proper underlying infrastructure is in place to allow for portability, performance,
  interoperability and scale. &nbsp;This talk will provide some context and examples
  around this growing software development model in the semiconductor industry.
