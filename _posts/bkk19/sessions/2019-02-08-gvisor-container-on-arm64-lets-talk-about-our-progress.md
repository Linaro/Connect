description: Google has released gVisor in 9 months ago, a new kind of sandbox that
  can be used to provide secure <br /> isolation for containers that is less resource
  intensive than running a full virtual machine (VM). <br /> <br /> At its core, gVisor
  is an open source user-space kernel, written in Go,<br /> that implements a substantial
  portion of the Linux system surface.<br /> It includes an Open Container Initiative
  (OCI) runtime called runsc that provides an isolation boundary between the application
  and the host kernel. <br /> The runsc runtime integrates with Docker and Kubernetes,
  making it simple to run sandboxed container.<br /> <br /> Now, we have enabled gVisor
  ptrace platform on Arm64 platform. In this presentation, we will introduce and show
  our progress. <br /> Also we will show a demo of gVisor on Arm64 platform.<br />
