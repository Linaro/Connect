description: Toolchain software forms the base of any development platform ranging
  from embedded devices all the way up to servers. The way to plan for toolchain enablement
  and integration however is very different as we go from embedded to the server ecosystem.
  In this session we look at how releases for various toolchain components (such as
  gcc, glibc and binutils) work, how they interact with server distributions and how
  all of that is quite different from how other components, especially the Linux kernel,
  work.
