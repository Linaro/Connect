description: It can be a rather complicated task to deploy optimized power management
  (PM) support in a driver in Linux. There are several PM frameworks and corresponding
  function callbacks available per device, which the driver developer needs detailed
  knowledge about. Particularly, when the goal is to reach the best energy efficient
  behavior.<br /> <br /> Additionally, ARM SoCs in general, have quite sophisticated
  and fine grained methods to put parts of a silicon into a low power state, as to
  avoid wasting power when there are no active users of these parts. In Linux these
  parts are typically modeled as so called, PM domains.<br /> <br /> During the session,
  we dive into some of the relevant PM frameworks for dealing with idle and explains
  the concepts behind them. We look into how to deploy support for system wide low
  power states, such as suspend to ram, suspend to idle and suspend to disk. We look
  at it, both from the PM domain and the driver point of view.<br /> <br /> Moreover,
  to deploy fine grained PM support, the session gives some best practices of how
  to use runtime PM and the generic PM domain frameworks, as well as looks into how
  to implement support for called wakeup interrupts.

- speaker_bio: Ulf has a very long experience of using Linux and has been contributing
    the Linux kernel development for many years by now. He maintains the MMC subsystem
    and the generic PM domain in the Linux kernel, but also spends lots of time reviewing
    various changes related to power management and to their corresponding frameworks.<br><br>Moreover,
    Ulf has a background in real-time and embedded systems. He also has an in-depth
    knowledge about flash memory technologies, such as NAND and NOR.<br><br>Ulf is
    working for Linaro and specializing in power management.
