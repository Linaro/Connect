description: The Arm Architecture is continually evolving as new features and enhancements
  are developed to meet existing market demand, and to enable new markets. Arm, Linaro,
  and the wider Arm ecosystem build on the core Architecture, creating a rich and
  varied range of products along with associated Firmware and Software, to drive the
  technologies of the future.<br /> <br /> This presentation will reveal the culmination
  of several years of new architecture development, intended to benefit both Client
  & Server systems.<br /> <br /> It will discuss the software enablement that is currently
  taking place, and the future development needs for the wider ecosystem, to ensure
  that software is in place and ready to support these features when the devices become
  available.
