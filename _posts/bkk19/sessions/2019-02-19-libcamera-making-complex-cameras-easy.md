description: Cameras are complex devices that need heavy hardware image processing
  operations. Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must
  run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a dedicated
  MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices algorithms have been moved to the main
  CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and Linux often left
  the user with no other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.<br
  /> <br /> To address this problem the V4L2 community is collaborating with industry
  leaders to develop a camera stack that will be open-source-friendly while still
  protecting vendor core IP. Libcamera is under active development and interested
  vendors have the opportunity to contribute and provide feedback to ensure we cover
  all use cases before the API is finalised.<br /> <br /> This talk will examine the
  libcamera architecture, and how it applies to embedded ARM devices. We will look
  at how vendors and developers can use the stack to their advantage, the areas they
  can contribute to, the benefits the stack will bring to them, and how they can influence
  the design.
