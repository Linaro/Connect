description: Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) is an implementation of Platform Security Architecture
  (PSA) for M class processors. TF-M includes a couple of secure services. Many partners
  want to take advantage of that to extend their PSA features.<br /> <br /> Our design
  is to extend TF-Mâ€™s services to Zephyr based dual-core SoC. A Zephyr instance runs
  in secure core with secure services, another Zephyr instance runs in non-secure
  core which can call secure services. For this solution, the first step is to modularize
  secure services in TF-M and remove service platform dependencies. Then start them
  as Zephyr threads in secure core. And at last, implement IPC interface for the service
  requests from non-secure core to secure core by leveraging openAMP which is supported
  in Zephyr. This session will discuss the TF-M secure services modularization, running
  secure services in Zephyr and the IPC implementation.<br />
