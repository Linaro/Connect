description: The future is an intelligent digital world, where everything is to be
  sensible, connected to the cloud and AI enabled. That brings huge amount of information,
  and the relative calculation power<br>requirements. However the scenarios for computing
  applications are varied. The diversity of applications and the resulting data are
  also diverse. Diverse applications produce diverse data,<br>including text, images,
  and video, as well as structured, unstructured data.<br><br>Because of the diversity
  of data, the appreciated computing architectures are also diverse. The ARM architecture
  has proved its value in the consumer-grade terminal industry. With the<br>continuous
  innovation of ARM architecture, the performance of enterprise-grade ARM CPU will
  be greatly improved, ARM architecture is moving toward edge computing and data centers
  from the end, however an open ecosystem is critical for this leap.<br>In this presentation
  Huawei will share their opinion and plans on how to build an open, competitive and
  win-win ARM data center ecosystem with industry partners.
