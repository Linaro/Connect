description: The Vanguard program looks to expand the potential technology choices
  for leadership class High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, not only for the
  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE),
  but also for the wider HPC community. Specifically, there is a need to expand the
  supercomputing ecosystem by investing and developing emerging, yet-to-be-proven
  technologies and address both hardware and software challenges together and prove-out
  the viability of such novel platforms for production workloads.<br /> <br /> The
  first deployment of Vanguard is Astra, a prototype Petascale ARM supercomputer sited
  at Sandia National Laboratories. This talk will focus on the architectural details
  of Astra, as well as the Advanced Tri-Lab Software Environment (ATSE) and significant
  investments being made towards the ARM software ecosystem. Furthermore, we will
  share initial performance results, first experiences, and outlay several planned
  research activities.

- speaker_bio: Andrew Younge is a Computer Scientist at Sandia National Laboratories
    with the Scalable System Software group. His research interests include High Performance
    Computing, Virtualization, Distributed Systems, and energy efficient computing.
    The central focal point of Andrewâ€™s work is to improve the usability and efficiency
    of supercomputing system software. He has a Ph.D in Computer Science from Indiana
    University, where he was the Persistent Systems fellow and a member of the FutureGrid
    project, an NSF-funded experimental Cloud testbed. Over the years, Andrew has
    held visiting positions at the MITRE Corporation, the University of Southern California
    / Information Sciences Institute, and the University of Maryland, College Park.
    He received his Bachelors and Masters of Science from the Computer Science Department
    at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in 2008 and 2010, respectively.
