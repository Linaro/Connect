description: Cloud Native is an approach to building and running applications that
  exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. It typically means
  to use containerized open source software stack, dynamically orchestrated and managed
  to optimize resource utilization.<br /> To build cloud native NFV infrastructure,
  in addition to containerized NFV orchestration engine, such as Kubernetes, we need
  high performance, scalable and micro-service oriented networking solutions to enable
  the seamless connection of cloud native applications.<br /> In this presentation,
  we would like to show cloud native NFV infrastructure networking solutions on Arm
  platforms. It will cover the following on Arm:<br /> 1. The building of Cloud Native
  NFV infrastructure with high performance networking support on arm platform; <br
  /> 2. Contiv/VPP based Kubernetes container networking solutions on arm and its
  performance evaluation;<br /> 3. Service Function Chain (SFC) and Network Service
  Mesh(NSM) enhancement for cloud native applications based on Contiv/VPP;<br /> 4.
  Cloud native applications fast deployment and service management;<br /> 5. Other
  cloud native networking solutions available on arm.<br />
