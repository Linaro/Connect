  "Open Source software stack for heterogeneous embedded devices<br /><br
  />\r\n<p>As heterogeneous embedded systems are getting more powerful and common
  place there are a number of complexities that come with creating the associated
  software stacks. This talk will cover some of these issues and discuss solutions,
  tying together topics such as heterogeneous HW (Xilinx Versal ACAP and Zynq MPSoC),
  use cases, OpenAMP, System Device Trees, Hypervisors, Cache coloring, Ultra96V2
  and CCIX.</p>\r\n<br />&nbsp;"
