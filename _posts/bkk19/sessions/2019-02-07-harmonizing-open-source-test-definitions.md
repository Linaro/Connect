description: Different test frameworks have very different approaches to tests, including
  when they run, how they are run, what data formats are used, and what the various
  fields are that control test operation and results analysis. Recently, Tim has conducted
  a survey of different "test definitions", in an attempt to cull best practices and
  search for commonality that will lead to enhanced interoperability between test
  systems. In this session, Tim will present the results of his survey, and make suggestions
  for areas where tests could be harmonized, and used in common between Fuego and
  Lava - two test systems with very different approaches.<br /> <br />
