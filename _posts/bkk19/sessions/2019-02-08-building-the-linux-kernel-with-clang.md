description: '> Linaro has been building on KernelCI to handle continuous integration
  of the Linux kernel with multiple different compilers and compiler versions. This
  is used for catching regressions upstream in the Linux kernel and LLVM code bases.
  This helps ensure that Android and ChromeOS can reliably ship LTS branches of the
  kernel built with Clang. Come learn more about building Linux kernels with Clang,
  and how Linaro is helping enable this work via KernelCI.'
