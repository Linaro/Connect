- speaker_bio: An industry veteran with broad leadership background across all Go-To-Market
    functions, I started as a product manager, driving advanced product development
    and launches at Silicon<br>Graphics. From there, I advanced into leadership roles,
    including Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at multiple companies.
    A deep understanding of technology and the<br>markets our partners serve, combined
    with a belief that partnerships are essential to developing complete solutions,
    provides a unique perspective and passion for technology that translates into
    real world benefits for our customers.<br><br>My experience spans a broad spectrum
    of company size and market focus from my current role leading the software ecosystem
    team for the Infrastructure Line of Business at Arm to large<br>enterprise companies
    (NetApp) to early stage startups (co-founder of Terawave). Early in my career,
    I was fortunate to spend ten years in Silicon Graphics, a small company when I
    first started that became a large company. Throughout my career, a focus on customer
    outcome through technology innovation and eco-system development, has remained
    a priority I have maintained throughout my career.
