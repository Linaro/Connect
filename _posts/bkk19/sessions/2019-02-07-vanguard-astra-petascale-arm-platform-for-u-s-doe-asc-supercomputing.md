description: The Vanguard program looks to expand the potential technology choices
  for leadership class High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms, not only for the
  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE),
  but also for the wider HPC community. Specifically, there is a need to expand the
  supercomputing ecosystem by investing and developing emerging, yet-to-be-proven
  technologies and address both hardware and software challenges together and prove-out
  the viability of such novel platforms for production workloads.<br /> <br /> The
  first deployment of Vanguard is Astra, a prototype Petascale ARM supercomputer sited
  at Sandia National Laboratories. This talk will focus on the architectural details
  of Astra, as well as the Advanced Tri-Lab Software Environment (ATSE) and significant
  investments being made towards the ARM software ecosystem. Furthermore, we will
  share initial performance results, first experiences, and outlay several planned
  research activities.
