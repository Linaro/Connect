description: While Virtual Machines have been around for many decades containers are
  a relatively new development. Their usage has grown rapidly as users have started
  designing solutions using swarms of micro services in on-demand clouds managed by
  orchestration systems. At the same time containers are really just a group of processes
  sharing a host kernel which has led to concerns about security and isolation if
  things go wrong. Efforts are now underway to bring the strong isolation of virtual
  machines into the free-wheeling world of rapidly updated<br /> containerised applications.<br
  /> <br /> This talk will give an overview of the two technologies and how they are
  being brought together to provide the best of both worlds. This includes topics
  such as making orchestration systems VM aware as well as projects to move container
  run times into specialised virtual machines. We will also discuss what else needs
  to be done to enable the ARM eco-system to take advantage of these two complimentary
  technologies.<br />

- speaker_bio: Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home
    computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating
    with a degree in Chemistry hes worked on a variety of projects including Fruit
    Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave
    systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with
    FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. An alumni of Transitive he has a broad experience
    of cross-platform virtualization as well as a strong background in telecommunications
    and networking. A keen Emacs user he will happily answer questions and proselytise
    for the One True Editor (tm).
