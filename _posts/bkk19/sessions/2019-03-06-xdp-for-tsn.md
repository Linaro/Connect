description: ne of the challenging tasks of TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) is itâ€™s
  low latency and bounded jitter strict requirements. Although XDP (eXpress Data Path)
  does not offer any jitter guarantees it offers significantly lower latency, by offloading
  traffic off the kernel and directly into user-space sockets (AF_XDP), compared to
  the linux kernel network stack. This talk is about a brief XDP introduction and
  the latency numbers we got on our initial tests.
