description: Autoware.AI was originally started in 2015 by Shinpei Kato at Nagoya
  University, and quickly grew into the worlds first "All-in-One" open-source software
  stack for autonomous driving. Built on ROS 1, Autoware provides modules for Localization,
  Detection, Prediction and Planning, as well as Control. Autoware.AI
  is a part of the newly introduced Autoware Foundation, which is a non-profit organisation
  created to develop a synergy between corporate development and academic research
  in order to provide access to autonomous driving technology for everyone.
   This talk will provide an introduction to the Autoware.AI software stack,
  as well as an in depth look into its modules.
