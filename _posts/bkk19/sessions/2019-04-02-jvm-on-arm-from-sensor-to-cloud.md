description: A variety of Java virtual machines on ARM have been around for a long
  time. Nowadays, OpenJDK makes it easy and secure to receive and process data at
  all stages. Using modern expressive language Kotlin and Docker containers, we will
  program a simple, but secure gateway that controls a sensor. Well demonstrate further
  data processing in the cloud as BigData and then visualization for end user using
  JavaFX. We will discuss additional features such as deployment and provisioning
  and also how the new release model of the Java platform is connected to security.

- speaker_bio: Dmitry Chuyko is a performance engineer at BellSoft, which is among
    the top 5 contributors to OpenJDK. Before joining BellSoft, Dmitry programmed
    in Java, and then worked on Hotspot JVM in Oracle. After all, previous experience
    with Java has shown that the most interesting problems in applications get their
    solutions in the base platform. Currently Dmitry mostly optimizes OpenJDK for
    ARM64, the company even implemented its own JEP 315 on Java 11 on this topic.<br
    />BellSoft releases and supports Liberica JDK -- a verified distribution of OpenJDK.
    Liberica is available in the form of binary assemblies, installers and container
    images for different operating systems and processors. Therefore, now the focus
    of attention is the work of various versions of Java in containers on ARM and
    x86.
