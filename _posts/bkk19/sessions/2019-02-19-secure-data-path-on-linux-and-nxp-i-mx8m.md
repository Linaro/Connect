description: 'This session will present the various aspects of providing a Secure
  Data Path (SDP) implementation on Linux and NXP i.MX8M. The implementation reuses
  some components from the SDP on Android (presented in HKG18-113): <br /> - hardware
  memory protections,<br /> - secure ION heaps for VPU and display,<br /> - ION integration
  in OP-TEE and in DRM implementations.<br /> On Linux, the implementation involves
  ION integration in OpenCDM and GStreamer.<br />'
