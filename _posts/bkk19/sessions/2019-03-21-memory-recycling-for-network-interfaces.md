description: As network interfaces keep getting faster drivers, CPUs and memory need
  to keep up. Linux kernel network drivers usually allocate memory on-the-fly, process
  the packets and then free that memory. This talk focuses on a proposed RFC about
  a native memory recycling strategy that applies on both the default network stack,
  XDP(eXpress Data Path) and the improvements it offers compared to the existing approach.<br
