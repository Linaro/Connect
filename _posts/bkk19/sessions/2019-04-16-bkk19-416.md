description: Test results triage is the most time-consuming step currently in Texas
  Instruments CI cycle. Embedded tests are more susceptible to failures caused by
  external factors due to test setup complexity. A typical embedded test contains
  multiple points of failure. <br /> This work uses a neural network to classify test
  results automatically and to detect real regressions. It helps scaling TIs validation
  cycle by automating the most time-consuming step.<br />
