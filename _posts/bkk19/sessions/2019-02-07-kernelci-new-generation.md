description: KernelCI generates daily an average of two thousand Linux Kernel builds,
  submitted to several labs across planet to mainly check if system booting works
  correctly. Therefore tons of data are created and displayed on a frontend interface
  for further use. Current KernelCI requires significant technical effort changing
  visualizations, including builds and jobs listings. The KernelCI New Generation
  seeks to apply state-of-the-art data collection and data visualization tools as
  an alternative frontend to KernelCI. Our focus is on an instance of ElasticSearch,
  Logstash, and Kibana collecting and displaying live KernelCI data. All the tooling
  used to this project will be available.
