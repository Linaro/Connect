description: The post-K is the successor of the Japanese flagship supercomputer, K.<br>RIKEN
  and Fujitsu have developed a new Arm-SVE enabled processor,<br>called A64FX, for
  the Post-K system. The processor is designed for<br>energy-efficiency and sustained
  application performance. The system<br>will be installed in the next year. In this
  talk, the features and<br>some preliminary performance of the post-K system will
  be presented,<br>as well as the schedule of the project and supported software.<br><br>

    Department of Information Science, School of Science, the University of Tokyo,
    and continued his study at the Graduate School of Science, the University of Tokyo,
    after which he joined the GOTO Quantum Magneto Flux Logic Project at the Research
    Development Corporation of Japan. In 1991 he joined the Electrotechnical Laboratory
    of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and from 1996 headed
    the Parallel and Distributed System Performance Laboratory of the Real World Computing
    Partnership. From 2001 to 2015 he served as Professor in the Graduate School of
    Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, and Director of the
    Center for Computational Sciences from 2007 to 2012.<br>At the RIKEN Advanced
