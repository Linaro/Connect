description: Modern CI/CD systems receive a wide variety of workloads, everything
  from quick jobs with simple dependencies that take less than a minute all the way
  up to full operating system rebuilds that can take hours or days. The needs of the
  software developer for quick turnaround of routine jobs are balanced against the
  system architect's expectation that expensive systems should not see undue amounts
  of idle time.<br /> <br /> This analysis looks at the challenges faced by a CI/CD
  system that incorporates a variety of machines of varying capacities, hosted by
  different organizations, where the individual systems themselves have varying degrees
  of parallel compute capabilities. We identify several real-world systems - NixOS's
  "nixpkgs", the FreeBSD build system, the LLVM build farm, and others - to pick out
  some important considerations.
