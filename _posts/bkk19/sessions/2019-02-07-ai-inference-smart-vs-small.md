description: Inference engines come in various forms and sizes which has a direct
  effect on their capabilities and memory footprint. During this presentation, we
  will look at different engine architectures and the memory trade-off implied by
  their target run-time environment, and some dissecting of ArmNN to put things in
  perspective with actual numbers.
