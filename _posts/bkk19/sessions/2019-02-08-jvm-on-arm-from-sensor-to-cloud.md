description: '> A variety of Java virtual machines on ARM have been around for a long
  time. Nowadays, OpenJDK makes it easy and secure to receive and process data at
  all stages. Using modern expressive language Kotlin and Docker containers, we will
  program a simple, but secure gateway that controls a sensor. We''ll demonstrate
  further data processing in the cloud as BigData and then visualization for end user
  using JavaFX. We will discuss additional features such as deployment and provisioning
  and also how the new release model of the Java platform is connected to security.'
