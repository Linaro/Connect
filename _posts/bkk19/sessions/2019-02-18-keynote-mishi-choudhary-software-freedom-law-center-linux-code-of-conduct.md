description: A fundamental change is happening in the way software is made in the<br>FOSS
  communities in the 21st century. These communities are now mature<br>and the people
  who work there understand their work place differently.<br>Over a decade and a half
  as more and more companies employ developers to<br>contribute to FOSS and the communities
  become diverse, different<br>expectations have begun to emerge from all stakeholders.
  These global<br>communities have narrower social interactions, say, around a &nbsp;water<br>cooler
  or in person, therefore, putting a premium on the way their<br>internal intermediated
  communication is &nbsp;conducted. This talk will<br>examine why Code of Conduct
  in this new world are on the rise and are a<br>positive sign for mature FOSS projects
  that govern themselves and dont<br>like suits. It will explore ways of &nbsp;managing
  legal risk by drafting<br>codes of conduct addressing bias, creating a frictionless
  reporting<br>mechanism for legal incident response, and making the project a fun,<br>inclusive
  productive place.
