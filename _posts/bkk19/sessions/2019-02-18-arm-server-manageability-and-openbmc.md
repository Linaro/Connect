description: Arm launched the ServerReady program at TechCon18. In addition to the
  SBSA and SBBR that constitute the ServerReady specifications, Arm Server Advisory
  Committee is also working on the SBMG document that addresses the server manageability.
  This presentation focuses on the updates in this area. It is also a call for action
  to the Linaro community to participate in the development of the SBMG and enhance
  the OpenBMC project as its reference implementation. SBMG is one of the main focus
  areas of development in the ServerReady program for 2019.<br />
