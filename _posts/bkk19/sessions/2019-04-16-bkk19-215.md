description: In this talk we are going to look into what it means to run a TEE in
  a TPM and answer questions like, what are the benefits and what the trade-offs when
  you are running a software based TPM in a TEE as a firmware TPM. For the second
  part of the talk we intend to have a more open discussion with the audience, where
  we want to discuss use cases and what kind changes that are necessary in boot components
  to be able talk to software based TPM instead of a real TPM.
