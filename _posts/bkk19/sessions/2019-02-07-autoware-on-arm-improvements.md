description: As members of the Autoware foundation it is Linaro’s hope to make improvements
  to Autoware’s code base, promote Automotive applications running on the ARM ecosystem,
  and foster the open source community while also providing good code support, practice,
  and standards. <br /> <br /> In this session we will talk about the difference between
  Autoware.ai and Autoware.Auto and the transition from ROS1 to ROS2 for Real Time
  applications. We will also mention Linaro’s efforts to make improvements to Autoware’s
  code and provide unit tests for the various Autoware modules. Finally we will talk
  about our efforts of getting Autoware running efficiently on ARM platforms.
