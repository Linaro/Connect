description: LAVA is at the same time supporting a wide range of devices and maintained
  by a small team of people. Which mean that maintainers do not have access to most
  device types that LAVA is supporting.<br /> LAVA Federation project is aiming at
  testing the LAVA software on community owned hardware. Every day, LAVA functional
  tests are spread across multiple labs, owned by the community members, with a variety
  of community hardware.<br /> <br /> The goal of this presentation is to help community
  members to jump in and participate to this common effort.
