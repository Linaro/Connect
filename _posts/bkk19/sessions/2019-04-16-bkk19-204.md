description: Open Asymmetric Multi-Processing (OpenAMP) provides an open source framework
  that allows operating systems to interact within a broad range of complex homogeneous
  and heterogeneous architectures and allows asymmetric multiprocessing applications
  to leverage parallelism offered by the multicore configuration. &nbsp;This session
  will introduce the framework and how to use it.
