description: As deep learning (DL) expands is application into ever more areas, DL
  at the edge has become an area of rapid innovation and has also become highly fragmented.
  This creates a challenge in the ecosystem for framework providers that want to take
  advantage of specialized hardware, and an equal challenge for SoC providers, or
  makers of DL accelerators that need to support various frameworks, customer innovations,
  device constraints, etc. This talk will explore what constitutes DL at the edge,
  it will highlight the recent trends in this area from runtimes and compilers, to
  model formats, and explore the challenges, and scalability needs of collaborative
  solutions.
