description: Arms Corstone-700 foundation IP offers a flexible compute architecture
  combining Cortex-A and Cortex-M processors.<br /> This will help enable a new generation
  of secure SoCs for rich IoT nodes, gateways, and embedded applications.<br /> <br
  /> The talk will focus on the open source software implications for these emerging
  devices. Topics include:<br /> - Open source OS/RTOS choices for different commute
  components<br /> - TinyLinux for memory constrained devices<br /> - Inter processor
  communication frameworks<br /> - Secure boot flow and run time services<br /> -
  Yocto recipes for managing software configuration
