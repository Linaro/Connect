description: '> Testing a bootloader in LAVA is more difficult than running tests
  on a typical Linux-based operating system such as Debian or Android. Robustly provisioning
  a new bootloader requires boards to be better designed for automation and to be
  deeply integrated into LAVA. For bootloaders, we often have to drive the tests externally
  since, with an OS or POSIX shell we cannot simply launch scripts to manage execution
  of the test suite.<br /> <br /> During this presentation, we will discuss these
  challenges in greater detail and look at what solutions LAVA offers to achieve bootloader
  automate testing. We’ll close out the session with an example test description that
  allows a bootloader test suite to be fully automated using LAVA.<br /> <br />'
