excerpt: Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new approach to networking, complementing
  traditional network architectures. SDN aims at the normalization of network configuration
  and control through open programmatic interfaces to individual network devices as
  well as to the whole network. This session puts the SDN concept into perspective
  with existing and evolving network architectures and principles.
