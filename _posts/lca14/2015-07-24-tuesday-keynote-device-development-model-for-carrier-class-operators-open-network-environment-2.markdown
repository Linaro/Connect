excerpt: "Radically revamping the device development model for Carrier class operators
  with ARM and Linaro\n \n Comcast? Software? Isn't that an oxymorom? See how the
  open source community and modern development models are re-shaping the feature velocity
  and security models for embedded devices like settop boxes, cable modems and gateways.
  Competing in the modern landscape means building products and experiences that compete
  with a new breed of innovators. Comcast's SVP, Engineering and Operations and Chief
  Software Architect will provide insight into how its reinvented its technology stack
  and product line."
