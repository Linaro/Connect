excerpt: 'GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) are becoming a relevant
  functional block on SoCs, particularly on the ARM ecosystem. Extracting full performance
  of a GPU is now becoming a combination of well integrated and optimized software
  and hardware. Motivated by that, there are many open GPU initiatives around the
  world using FPGAs, but most (if not all) of these are on Intel platforms. This project
  aims to present an open GPU based on a FPGA using the ARM Instruction Set. The driver
  platform adopted was the well known MESA 3D (www.mesa3d.org). We will describe the
  co-design approach to designing the OpenGPU. A fully functional hardware and software
  implementation of the OpenGPU working on a range of OpenGL applications ported by
  Linaro will be shown. On the fly we will change drivers between: software model
  only, native software and hardware (OpenGPU) on FPGA, to see its performance impact.
  The engineers that implemented this system will be at the session to support detailed
  technical questions.'

★ Session Summary ★
GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) are becoming a relevant functional block on SoCs, particularly on the ARM ecosystem. Extracting full performance of a GPU is now becoming a combination of well integrated and optimized software and hardware. Motivated by that, there are many open GPU initiatives around the world using FPGAs, but most (if not all) of these are on Intel platforms. This project aims to present an open GPU based on a FPGA using the ARM Instruction Set. The driver platform adopted was the well known MESA 3D (www.mesa3d.org). We will describe the co-design approach to designing the OpenGPU. A fully functional hardware and software implementation of the OpenGPU working on a range of OpenGL applications ported by Linaro will be shown. On the fly we will change drivers between: software model only, native software and hardware (OpenGPU) on FPGA, to see its performance impact. The engineers that implemented this system will be at the session to support detailed technical questions.
