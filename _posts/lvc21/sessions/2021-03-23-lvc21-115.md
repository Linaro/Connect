description: "Arm SystemReady is a new compliance program bringing a level of consistency
  across a broad range of A-profile Arm-based devices, in the cloud, at the edge,
  and in high-performance IoT (HPIoT) endpoints. It includes new set of standards
  and a compliance certification program, with the goal of ensuring that Arm systems
  \"Just Work\" with standard off-the-shelf operating systems and hypervisors.\r\n\r\nThis
  talk introduces the Arm SystemReady program, and the underlying requirements, focusing
  on the SystemReady SR and ES bands for servers, embedded servers, and Infrastructure
  edge devices. We will show-case enablement efforts for devices in these bands, using
  TianoCore EDK2 open source firmware. We will also highlight the firmware test suites,
  and best practices for building compliant systems."

Arm SystemReady is a new compliance program bringing a level of consistency across a broad range of A-profile Arm-based devices, in the cloud, at the edge, and in high-performance IoT (HPIoT) endpoints. It includes new set of standards and a compliance certification program, with the goal of ensuring that Arm systems "Just Work" with standard off-the-shelf operating systems and hypervisors.

This talk introduces the Arm SystemReady program, and the underlying requirements, focusing on the SystemReady SR and ES bands for servers, embedded servers, and Infrastructure edge devices. We will show-case enablement efforts for devices in these bands, using TianoCore EDK2 open source firmware. We will also highlight the firmware test suites, and best practices for building compliant systems.
