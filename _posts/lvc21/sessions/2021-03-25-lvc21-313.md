description: "Under development for many years, support for video CODEC accelerators
  in Linux gained significant traction in 2020. A formal specification was merged
  into the Linux Media subsystem in v5.5, allowing for blob free hardware accelerated
  decoding on popular platforms such as Allwinner, NXP i.MX8, Microchip SAMA5, and
  Rockchip. In addition, H.264 V4L2 controls were destaged in v5.11, and the remaining
  CODEC controls will be coming soon to mainline.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take
  a deep dive into stateless video decoder support for Linux, including an overview
  of the decoding process using hardware accelerators, a look at the user space API
  and how it's used within multimedia frameworks, and how this all works with modern
  GPU accelerators. Lastly, this presentation would not be complete without discussing
  the effort to bring native support in FFMPEG and GStreamer, and its major role in
  the development of the new Open Source drivers."
