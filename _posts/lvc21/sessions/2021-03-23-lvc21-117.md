description: "SystemReady is Arm's new compliance program for ensuring compatibility
  between Arm A-Profile platforms and the operating system ecosystem, and based on
  our success with the ServerReady program for the enterprise market.\r\n\r\nThe SystemReady
  IR (IoT Ready) band is specifically designed to support the embedded Linux IoT and
  Edge markets. It adopts some of the technologies used in the server oriented -SR
  band, but it also takes into account the needs and sensibilities of the embedded
  Linux ecosystem, including a familiar software stack and the ability to customize
  the platform.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we'll discuss the requirements of SystemReady-IR,
  and steps through the process of enabling the required features and testing for
  compliance. A demonstration will be shown using the Compulab IOT-GATE-IMX8 device
  as a target platform running upstream U-Boot, TF-A, and OP-TEE. The platform implements
  the UEFI ABI and will run both the UEFI Self Certification Test (SCT) and generic
  Linux distro installer images."

SystemReady is Arm's new compliance program for ensuring compatibility between Arm A-Profile platforms and the operating system ecosystem, and based on our success with the ServerReady program for the enterprise market.

The SystemReady IR (IoT Ready) band is specifically designed to support the embedded Linux IoT and Edge markets. It adopts some of the technologies used in the server oriented -SR band, but it also takes into account the needs and sensibilities of the embedded Linux ecosystem, including a familiar software stack and the ability to customize the platform.

In this presentation we'll discuss the requirements of SystemReady-IR, and steps through the process of enabling the required features and testing for compliance. A demonstration will be shown using the Compulab IOT-GATE-IMX8 device as a target platform running upstream U-Boot, TF-A, and OP-TEE. The platform implements the UEFI ABI and will run both the UEFI Self Certification Test (SCT) and generic Linux distro installer images.
