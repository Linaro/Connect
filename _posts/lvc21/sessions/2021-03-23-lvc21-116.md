description: Give an overview of physical attacks and how can they be applied to compromise
  system security (bypass secure boot or the configuration of memory isolation hardware
  elements). Introduce software countermeasures against physical attacks to mitigate
  them. Show in practice how these countermeasures are implemented in MCUboot project
  and TF-M runtime. Talk about the challenges and solutions of implementing these
  countermeasures in open-source projects. Introduce a QEMU based test environment
  which meant to simulate the effects of physical attacks on software execution.

    areas are secure boot, device attestation and preparation the Musca test chips
    to PSA certification. In my free time, I'm a passionate rock climber.\r\n"

- speaker_bio: I'm a recent(ish) graduate of the University of Bristol, where I studied
    computer science with a focus on security, crypto and hardware architecture.  I've
    been working on the TF-M team since then, splitting my time between fault injection
    mitigation and the cmake buildsystem. In my free time, I enjoy long-distance hiking
    and mountaineering.
