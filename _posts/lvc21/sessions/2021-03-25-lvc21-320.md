When discussing an OpenEmbedded derived distribution, it is common to hear things like "I don't want to take the time build from source", "We don't need that level of control and optimization", "We just need to boot and demo" or "Can I create and deploy that with a Dockerfile ?". These type of questions and
concerns are valid, but are addressed by the latest  dvancements in the Yocto project ecosystem.

As projects evolve, so do their requirements and use cases. Questions may become: "How do I rebuild a package?", "How can someone develop applications against my image/distribution?", "How can I integrate 3rd party packages?", "How do I go to production and support?" or "How can I deploy updates and
new applications?".

This means that the flexibility of the build environment becomes important as do the outputs of that environment. This talk will discuss how although OpenEmbedded was traditionally source based, it can produce a number of binary outputs. Those outputs can be used to create landing points on the ease of use
continuum between well known alternatives such as alpine through debian, as well as provide a path from demo to production to wide scale cloud deployment.

It will also include examples of how these binary outputs can be used in traditional package feed/update mechanisms, as well as in new environments such as Dockerfile builds or cloud-native base images.

Finally, how Xilinx may leverage these capabilities to enhance the accessibility and platform integration will be discussed.
