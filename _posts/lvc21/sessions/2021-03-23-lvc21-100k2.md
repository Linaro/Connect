description: 'Bringing together the transformative power of 5G and AI technologies
  is essential to creating the next generation of high-compute, low-power robots and
  drones for the consumer, enterprise, defense, industrial, and professional service
  sectors. In this keynote session, Dev Singh, Qualcomm Technologies’ GM of robotics,
  will discuss how scaling 5G and AI will help solve a diverse set of robotics challenges
  -- from enabling enhanced security and connectivity to high-accuracy AI inferencing
  and superior power-efficiency. Dev will discuss how this is key to enabling the
  robotics ecosystem and accelerating growth in segments from automated guided vehicles
  (AGV), autonomous mobile robots (AMR), delivery robots, and drones to inventory,
  industrial, and collaborative robots. '
