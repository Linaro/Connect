title: 'LVC21-321: AArch64 Laptops for Linux Developers'
---

Only recently have AArch64 laptops arrived on the market that are suitable for Linux developers. This session will review the options and support for upstream Linux kernels, GNU user space and associated tooling that make up a modern GNU/Linux distribution.

We will focus on laptops that provide UEFI boot process and review specific platforms for their current status. We will discuss the outstanding tasks needed to make the platforms comparable with more established Linux laptop platforms. We also expect to cover our the specification of an ideal AArch64 laptop.
