description: "The adoption of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology is prevalent
  in many industries. We have been active in the TEE security field since its inception,
  more than a decade ago. Since then, we have seen TEE security overall improve due
  to technology advances, like the new ARM v8.4 features, to increased awareness being
  spread (e.g. at Linaro Connect!) and significant improvements in design (e.g. see
  OP-TEE).\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the availability of technology alone is not sufficient
  for securing a TEE adequately. Even today, we find weaknesses due to shortcomings,
  requiring the necessary awareness and attention to be addressed. In this talk, we
  put the spotlight on several important challenges and pitfalls that may undermine
  the ability to effectively secure a TEE-based product. We touch upon assumptions
  made during design, implementation weaknesses, overlooked configurations, insufficient
  processes and ecosystem peculiarities. All of which may affect TEE security negatively
  and give opportunity for attackers to succeed.\r\n\r\nMany of the challenges can
  be addressed at the technology level whereas others require an increased level of
  understanding and awareness. With our talk, we aim to encourage adoption of new
  technological solutions and foster key reflections that may spark useful discussions
  in the industry, hopefully, contributing to the advancement of TEE security."
