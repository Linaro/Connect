TensorFlow Lite is a popular open-source framework that enables Machine Learning on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices by default using the Arm NEON instruction set. The delegate mechanism takes TensorFlow Lite one step further and provides a mechanism to use on-device hardware accelerators such as the GPU, NPU, or Digital Signal Processor.
