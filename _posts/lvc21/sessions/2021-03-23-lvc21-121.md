description: The Firmware Configuration (FConf) feature of the Trusted Firmware A-class
  (TF-A) project provides an abstraction mechanism to use Device Tree Blob (DTB) representations
  of platform-specific firmware information to be used by TF-A BL images. This reduces
  source code complexity and fragmentation across SoC families comprising of multiple
  platforms. We discuss how we leveraged Fconf to migrate CoT descriptors to a device
  tree.
