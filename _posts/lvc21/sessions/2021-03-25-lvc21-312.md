Overview of the FF-A SMPC implementation running at S-EL1 targeting pre-8.4 Cortex-A devices.

Arm® Firmware Framework for Armv8-A [1] describes a software architecture and interfaces that standardize isolation and communication between the various software components.

This session focuses on the changes introduced to the upstream OP-TEE kernel to enable booting and runtime management of S-EL0 Secure Partitions in line with the Firmware Framework.
