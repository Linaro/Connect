description: The arrival of the fifth-generation mobile network, known as 5G, promises
  an even more connected world, with billions of devices, from smartphones to connected
  vehicles, including network gateways, always-connected laptops, telemedicine machines,
  IoT gadgets, etc. With Linux being the major OS in the embedded world, Linux support
  for WWAN modems is more than ever a major topic that will certainly impact industries
  over this decade. During this presentation, I’ll give a brief state of the art of
  cellular modem support in Linux, the software stack and its components, and how
  Linaro, with its partners, contribute to upstream cutting-edge modems support in
  Linux.
