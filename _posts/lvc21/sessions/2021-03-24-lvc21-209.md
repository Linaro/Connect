description: An Introduction to the work being done at 96Boards in partnership with
  PX4 and our hardware partners. This session will go through new Mezzanine and SOM
  based 96Boards products that are meant to bridge the PX4 ecosystem with ours. We
  aim to bring the power of Arm based APUs, FPGAs and ASIC accelerators to the widely
  adopted Pixhawk drone stack. This collaboration aims to provide a one-stop-shop
  experience for solutions such as Aerial SLAM, Photogrammetry, cinematography, logistics,
  site management etc.
