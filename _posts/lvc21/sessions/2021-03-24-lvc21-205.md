Firmware update support is essential for IoT devices. However, the mechanism to update firmware on a device differs significantly across embedded platforms. TrustedFirmware-M(TF-M) proposes a set of Firmware Update(FWU) interfaces for updating firmware. By providing a consistent interface, the update clients and cloud connectors can be implemented in a more platform-independent manner.

TF-M Firmware Update service implements the Firmware Update APIs in the secure side. TF-M also provides a shim layer between firmware update service and bootloader. A specific bootloader can easily co-work with TF-M firmware update service via the shim layer.

We made a demo which integrated the TF-M Firmware Update service with the Amazon FreeRTOS OTA library. The OTA agent running in the non-secure side handles the image download from the AWS cloud. It calls the TF-M Firmware Update service via the Firmware Update APIs. It shows how the TF-M firmware update service cooperates with the OTA application to securely update the firmware.
