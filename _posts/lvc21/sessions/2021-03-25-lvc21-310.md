description: "The landscape of Linux kernel testing and CI is notoriously fragmented.
  Systems like Linaro's LKFT, Intel's 0day, Google's Syzbot, Red Hat's CKI, and others,
  are each running their own tests, sending separate emails, and hosting different
  dashboards. As a result, developers have to cope with multiple diverse reports arriving
  at various stages of development cycle, and it's difficult to correlate and analyze
  results. The Linux Foundation's KernelCI project has been working on a CI stack
  and service for all to use, which is seeing increasing adoption. However, the project
  has also started a new effort aimed at already-established CI systems, letting participants
  keep their setups, but submit testing results to a common database and reporting
  system, using a simple, extensible protocol.\r\n\r\nThe system behind the new effort
  is called \"KCIDB\" (for \"KernelCI Database\") and is already receiving reports
  from the native KernelCI tests, RedHat's CKI and Google's Syzbot, with more systems
  working on joining. Our aim is to develop a unified report protocol and schema,
  maintain an open result database, provide a single dashboard, and to send email
  notifications aggregating the data from all the participating systems. We want to
  reduce developer load, and make it easier to discover and analyze kernel testing
  results.\r\n\r\nJoin this session to find out how far we've got, how our dashboard
  and email notifications look, how we're pulling this off, what the protocol and
  the schema is like, and how to start sending your reports or join the development."

The landscape of Linux kernel testing and CI is notoriously fragmented. Systems like Linaro's LKFT, Intel's 0day, Google's Syzbot, Red Hat's CKI, and others, are each running their own tests, sending separate emails, and hosting different dashboards. As a result, developers have to cope with multiple diverse reports arriving at various stages of development cycle, and it's difficult to correlate and analyze results. The Linux Foundation's KernelCI project has been working on a CI stack and service for all to use, which is seeing increasing adoption. However, the project has also started a new effort aimed at already-established CI systems, letting participants keep their setups, but submit testing results to a common database and reporting system, using a simple, extensible protocol.

The system behind the new effort is called "KCIDB" (for "KernelCI Database") and is already receiving reports from the native KernelCI tests, RedHat's CKI and Google's Syzbot, with more systems working on joining. Our aim is to develop a unified report protocol and schema, maintain an open result database, provide a single dashboard, and to send email notifications aggregating the data from all the participating systems. We want to reduce developer load, and make it easier to discover and analyze kernel testing results.
