There are many ways of building latest Linux from the sources and deploy to almost any available board / PC.

But what about Android?

In this presentation I will share our experience of bringing-up latest Android to the set of most usable consumer-level SBCs (Raspberry, Orange PIs, etc.). We will talk about problems we faced and solutions we came up with.

Agenda:

1. Our philosophy and goals

2. Improving Android HALs such as:
  - drm_hwcomposer
  - gbm_gralloc
  - minigbm
  - integration with mainline mesa3d

3. Unification of graphic stack between all FOSS Android teams (GloDroid boards, LineageOS-based projects, Android-x86, In-AOSP boards)

4. Future plans.

5. DEMO: How to add support for a new board to the GloDroid project.
