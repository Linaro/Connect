description: The success of mobile and smart devices leads to an ever-growing demand
  of functions and features in yet traditional industries. This is also the case for
  heavy machinery like agricultural or constructions machines. In the wake of this
  trend electronic architectures are changing and yet clearly separated and seemingly
  incompatible industry sectors grow together. Hence, Open Source enables us at Bosch
  and Bosch Rexroth to learn and develop faster while in parallel keeping and even
  increasing our product quality.
