- speaker_bio: "Will Lovett joined Arm in 2014, to lead a new team developing LLVM
    compiler support for a prototype vector extension to AArch64, designed for HPC.
    This extension eventually became SVE, and the compiler work formed the basis of
    Arm Compiler for Linux, a fully functional C, C++ and Fortran toolchain with a
    highly tuned math library. In addition to the commercial product, the team at
    Arm are tasked with enabling the open source ecosystem. We are providing support
    for SVE and SVE2 in upstream LLVM and committed to ensuring F18 becomes a healthy
    and vibrant LLVM project. Prior to joining Arm, Will worked on dynamic binary
    translation with a startup called Transitive, and a number of roles for IBM, including
    whole-system process tuning and storage system design.\r\nWill works as part of
    a team in the Arm Manchester Design Centre, and lives in Kendal, UK"
