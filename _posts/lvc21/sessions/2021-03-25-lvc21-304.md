Linaro has made significant contributions in research, development and maintenance of Arm architecture support in GDB and LLDB debuggers. We are enabling debugger support for modern Arm architecture features like Scalable Vectors Extension (SVE), Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) and Pointer Authentication Code (PAC). We have also made contribution to Morello research project for supporting both GDB and LLDB debugger for its GNU and LLVM based toolchains.

In this talk Linaro’s toolchain team will give an update on on-going and completed debugger project in past year.
