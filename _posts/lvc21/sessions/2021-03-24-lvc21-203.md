description: We have developed Xbyak_aarch64, a just-in-time (JIT) assembler for Armv8-A.
  JIT assembler can generate executable code dynamically depending on the runtime
  environment (available instruction set, cache size, runtime parameters, etc.), so
  it can be used for applications that want to tune the performance to the extreme.
  As an example of the success of Xbyak_aarch64, the Arm CPU-based supercomputer Fugaku
  achieved the world's best performance in Deep Learning training process among CPU-based
  high performance systems last year (https://www.fujitsu.com/global/about/resources/news/press-releases/2020/1119-02.html).
  Xbyak_aarch64 is available as an OSS source on github.com/fujitsu/xbyak_aarch64.
  Anyone can use it and participate in its development.
