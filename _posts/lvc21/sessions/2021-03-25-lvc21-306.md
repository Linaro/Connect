description: The purpose of this presentation is to show how someone can leverage
  open source projects, such as Zephyr and Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) when it comes
  to certificate management (e.g. X.509). In this session we will go throught a simple
  application, which might serve as a good example if someone is building a connected
  and secure embedded device.
