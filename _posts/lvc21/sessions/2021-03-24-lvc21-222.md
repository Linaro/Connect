Both Daniel and Ilias both long been interested in the quest for an affordable 64-bit Arm workstation capable of handling lots of RAM and storage. Daniel has even taken to the stage at previous Linaro events to discuss his dogfooding experiences.
     
Following the time honoured traditions of previous Arm-on-Arm      enthusiasts, both these developers have adopted a new board      to be the heart of their "daily driver" workstations. The board      in question is a Honeycomb LX2K from Solidrun, a mini ITX board      built around a surprisingly powerful NXP networking and      communications chip.

Did they learn anything new this time around?
