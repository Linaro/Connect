description: This talk will provide an overview of Arm SystemReady, a recently launched
  certification program based on a set of standards that enable interoperability with
  generic, off-the-shelf operating systems and hypervisors. SystemReady extends the
  former Arm ServerReady program to the embedded and IoT sector and we will cover
  the steps needed to make software ‘Just Work’ on these diverse platforms.
