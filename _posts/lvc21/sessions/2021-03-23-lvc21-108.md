  Devicetree for EBBR and SystemReady IR, System Devicetree, Devicetree for RTOS,
  and a customer perspective of consuming Devicetree based systems. \r\n\r\nEach perspective
  will give a 5 minute update including what has been accomplished, what is being

Devicetree remains an important part of the boot architecture for many ARM SOCs.  

This session will look at Devicetree from 4 different perspectives: Devicetree for EBBR and SystemReady IR, System Devicetree, Devicetree for RTOS, and a customer perspective of consuming Devicetree based systems. 

Each perspective will give a 5 minute update including what has been accomplished, what is being worked on now, and what is expected to be done in the next 6 to 12 months.
