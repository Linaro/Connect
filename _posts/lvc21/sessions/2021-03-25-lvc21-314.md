description: "The motivation of supporting VirtIO on Xen (Arm) is quite clear.\r\nThere
  is an increasing interest and requirement to have flexible, generic and standardized
  cross-hypervisor solution for I/O virtualization in the automotive and embedded
  areas. Providing a standardized interface and device models for device para-virtualization
  in hypervisor environments, the VirtIO interface allows us to move Guest domains
  among different hypervisor systems without further modification at the Guest side.
  Xen hasn’t supported VirtIO on Arm so far, this is a significant gap in the list
  of supported features and this gap needs to be filled.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will
  briefly describe the possible approach of implementing virtio-mmio on Xen (Arm)
  using Xen's IOREQ Server (I/O Request Server) feature to forward guest MMIO access
  to a DM (device model) which could be used to implement a virtio-mmio backend or
  even mediator outside of the hypervisor.\r\nI will outline the advantages and disadvantages
  of this approach as well as open questions/concerns regarding security, performance
  in the proposed approach and possible steps for the improvement.\r\nAlso I am going
  to demonstrate a PoC on Arm64 based board powered by Xen with Guest running on VirtIO
  block device instead of a traditional Xen PV block device without any specific modifications
  to the Guest OS."
