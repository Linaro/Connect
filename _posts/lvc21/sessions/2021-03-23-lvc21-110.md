- speaker_bio: I'm a FOSS developer primarily focused on kernel and compiler development,
    bug fixing, and performance. As an OpenJDK committer I spent the last 5 years
    or so optimizing and enabling the HotSpot JVM for the Power platform. Currently
    I'm focused on the Apache TVM ML compiler framework, mainly working with the microTVM
    component for the ARM MCUs.
