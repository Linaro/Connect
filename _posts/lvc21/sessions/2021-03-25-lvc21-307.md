description: "Platform Security Architecture Firmware Framework For A Profile (PSA
  FF-A) specification defines an architecture that allows standardized communication
  among various software stacks, running across Normal and Secure world. FF-A defines
  the architecture of a Secure Partition Manager (SPM) that manages this standardized
  communication. It is split into two components – the SPM-Core (SPMC) and SPM-Dispatcher
  (SPMD). SPMD is part of the secure monitor executing at EL3. But SPMC, based on
  the hardware and architectural requirements, can exist in either EL3, S-EL2 or S-EL1.\r\n\r\nThis
  talk focuses on secure software architecture for Arm platforms that support the
  use of FF-A defined SPMD and SPMC components at EL3 and secure partitions at secure
  user mode (S-EL0). This software architecture is targeted to be deployed on Arm
  platforms that do not support virtualization in the secure world. Typical uses of
  such a software architecture include enabling support for UEFI secure boot and handling
  of secure platform hardware errors. There has been significant progress in this
  direction and multiple software components including EDK II, StandaloneMM and Trusted
  firmware have been enabled to support the FF-A defined software architecture. This
  talk uses Arm’s Neoverse reference design platform as an example to demonstrate
  the deployment of this software architecture and typical uses.\r\n\r\nKey objectives
  of this talk are to present the details on deploying this software architecture
  on Arm platforms and discuss other possible secure partition scenarios with the
  audience."
