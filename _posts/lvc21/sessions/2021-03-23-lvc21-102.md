title: 'LVC21-102: Functional Safety for FOSS - Xen Project journey'

The use of FOSS for safety-critical domains is considered highly interesting by industries such as automotive, as it enables a shorter time-to-market and lower development costs for generic components. However, formal functional safety requirements are very hard to implement, and it was never done before for mainline of generic FOSS projects, which were initially created without safety in mind. 
In this talk I will cover Linux Foundation's Xen Project developments for Automotive industry, our community approach for Functional Safety requirements compliance and our progress so far.
