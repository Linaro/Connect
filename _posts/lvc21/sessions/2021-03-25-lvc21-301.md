title: 'LVC21-301: True Story: How Rust for AArch64 Linux became a Tier-1 target platform'
---

On Dec 31st 2020 the Rust language community announced that the AArch64 Linux Rust target is now a Tier-1 Rust target. (See https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/12/31/Rust-1.49.0.html).

This is a significant development given Rust’s suitability for - and increasing uptake in - safety and security sensitive application domains where Arm IP is dominant and Linux is a given.

Getting Rust on AArch64 Linux to Tier-1 has been an intensive exercise involving collaboration across multiple organizations.

In this talk, Robin Randhawa (a system software architect at Arm and a long time friend of Linaro from the early days) and Florian Gilcher (Rust lang Core Team representative), both heavily invested in the Tier-1 initiative, will share how Tier-1 was attained and why it is an important step in a larger story. One that aims to bring the benefits of Rust’s safety guarantees to the larger Arm ecosystem.

In doing so, they will cover related aspects such as:

- What is Rust all about ?

- Why it matters for Arm and how Arm dove into Rust!

- Where is Rust being used in production ?

- Working towards a viable path to an ISO grade Rust language specification

- A multi-pronged approach to ‘oxidising’ system software for Cortex-{A, R, M} processor profiles

- Next steps on this journey and how to participate
