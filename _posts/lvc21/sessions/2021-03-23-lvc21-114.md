description: "This topic needs no real introduction, as the Arm Community has spoken
  about the needs for Standards and easier booting of devices for years now.  However,
  let's take a fresh look at the \"why\" this matters for businesses.  In this talk,
  I will present a tale of board-enablement for two devices, one x86 and one aarch64,
  in order to reach a point of booting and running a container.\r\n\r\nIn addition
  to the actual financial consequences due to the lack of standardized booting, I
  will also talk about the scalability issues faced when attempting to grow IoT projects
  and expand edge computing workloads.\r\n\r\n"

This topic needs no real introduction, as the Arm Community has spoken about the needs for Standards and easier booting of devices for years now.  However, let's take a fresh look at the "why" this matters for businesses.  In this talk, I will present a tale of board-enablement for two devices, one x86 and one aarch64, in order to reach a point of booting and running a container.

In addition to the actual financial consequences due to the lack of standardized booting, I will also talk about the scalability issues faced when attempting to grow IoT projects and expand edge computing workloads.
