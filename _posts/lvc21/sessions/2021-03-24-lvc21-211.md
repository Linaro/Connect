---

With more players join the game, the opensource software ecosystem have been greatly enhanced during last year, over 30 new top opensource projects have built their Arm CI and will continue to dev, build and test on Arm platform. 

And that brings us to the next step - How good did they run? Are they competitive with other platforms? Are there any general rules to improve their performance on Arm platform?

In this session, we will share ideas and best practices on how can we imporve application performance on Arm data centers with both software and hardware techniques. We will cover fields including BigData, Databases and general libraries like glibc, gzip etc.
