excerpt: 'For connected embedded systems we can broadly consider security across four
  different areas: Security within a cloud application/platform. Lifecycle security
  for large deployments of embedded devices. Communication security between internet
  connected systems. Local device security implemented within end nodes. Each connected
  end node needs to support aspects of lifecycle, communication and device security
  according to application needs. It is not scalable (or secure or productive) to
  start from scratch, implementing all of these aspects for each development. It is
  also not a good idea to implement static, closed, proprietary security systems which
  rely more on “security by obscurity” than on thorough, continuous and open validation
  of security implementations. Developers need comprehensive and flexible SW security
  frameworks with strong links to MCU HW security features that enable them to efficiently
  implement, validate and deploy “right sized” security solutions. This session will
  discuss the solutions that are available today, how to reason effectively about
  application security requirements and opportunities to evolve embedded security
  solutions in the future.'

LAS16-308: Mini Conference 2 Cortex-M Software - Security Architecture for Cortex-M
Speakers: Paul Bakker
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
For connected embedded systems we can broadly consider security across four different areas: Security within a cloud application/platform. Lifecycle security for large deployments of embedded devices. Communication security between internet connected systems. Local device security implemented within end nodes. Each connected end node needs to support aspects of lifecycle, communication and device security according to application needs. It is not scalable (or secure or productive) to start from scratch, implementing all of these aspects for each development. It is also not a good idea to implement static, closed, proprietary security systems which rely more on “security by obscurity” than on thorough, continuous and open validation of security implementations. Developers need comprehensive and flexible SW security frameworks with strong links to MCU HW security features that enable them to efficiently implement, validate and deploy “right sized” security solutions. This session will discuss the solutions that are available today, how to reason effectively about application security requirements and opportunities to evolve embedded security solutions in the future.
