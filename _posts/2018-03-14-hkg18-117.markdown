excerpt: 'Kubernetes is a commonly used Container Orchestration Engine today. It is
  an open-source cloud platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations
  of application containers across clusters of hosts. With Kubernetes, we can setup
  a container cloud platform in a short time. But Kubernetes still lacks some critical
  features that are important for a high performance containerized VNF in a typical
  NFV environment. To help address it, we put a lot job around this area, also pushed
  several patches into open source community. In this presentation, I will introduce
  and show the jobs that how to improve application performance, and IO throughput
  in Kubernetes. Key features are now available in Kubernetes to bring benefits for
  high performance cloud platform. Some of these enhanced features: 1, ‘Node feature
  discovery’ identifies hardware features and advertises them in Kubernetes 2, SRIOV
  CNI provides DPDK fast path networking for VNF 3, CPU Manger for Kubernetes delivers
  predictable network performance 4, Huge page management in Kubernetes enables the
  discovery, scheduling and allocation of huge pages as resource'
