excerpt: The GNU C library has a number of magic constants that were decided based
  on performance and resource data available when they were first introduced. Those
  constants may be suboptimal for some loads and may have even been rendered incorrect
  due to advances in other components or hardware. Further, there are a number of
  global configuration variables that were added over the years to work around the
  problems posed by such magic constants (the MMAP_THRESHOLD in malloc is one such
  example). These variables have ad hoc names and each have their own scheme of initialization
  and maintenance. A tunables framework aims to provide a layer that manages such
  global configuration and provides a unified interface to programmers, system administrators,
  and integrators to tweak this configuration. This talk describes the architecture
  of this layer and the interface it provides and also describes the potential roadmap
  for this feature in glibc.
