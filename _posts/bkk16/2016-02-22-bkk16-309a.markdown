excerpt: 'Last year, to provide at least a stop-gap solution to the problem of getting
  platform support upstreamed into EDK2, I created a separate repository called OpenPlatformPkg
  as a way to start keeping and organising opensource platform support.


  This presentation goes through how to use and contribute to this repository, as
  well as providing a bit of an update about what is going on with getting platform
  code with EDK2 solved upstream.'

Last year, to provide at least a stop-gap solution to the problem of getting platform support upstreamed into EDK2, I created a separate repository called OpenPlatformPkg as a way to start keeping and organising opensource platform support.  This presentation goes through how to use and contribute to this repository, as well as providing a bit of an update about what is going on with getting platform code with EDK2 solved upstream.
