excerpt: 'The linux kernel has two distinct ways of managing idle. The CPUidle framework
  for CPUs and for all other devices: runtime PM combined with generic power domains
  (genpd). In addition, CPUidle is not scaling well for multi-cluster SMP systems
  and heterogeneous systems like big.LITTLE. To better manage idle for modern SoCs
  with a hierarchical structure, we are exploring extending runtime PM and genpd to
  CPUs so there is a unified framework for managing idle across all devices.'

The linux kernel has two distinct ways of managing idle. The CPUidle framework for CPUs and for all other devices: runtime PM combined with generic power domains (genpd). In addition, CPUidle is not scaling well for multi-cluster SMP systems and heterogeneous systems like big.LITTLE. To better manage idle for modern SoCs with a hierarchical structure, we are exploring extending runtime PM and genpd to CPUs so there is a unified framework for managing idle across all devices.
