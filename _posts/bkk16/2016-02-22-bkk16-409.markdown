excerpt: Virtual Open Systems has developed VOSYSwitch, a high-performance user space
  networking virtual switch solution enabling NFV, based on the open source packet
  processing framework SnabbSwitch. In this talk, the experience of porting VOSYSwitch
  from x86 to Armv8 will be shared, along with the integration of ODP as a driver
  layer for the available hardware resources. In addition to this presentation, a
  live demonstration will showcase chained VNFs connected through VOSYSwitch, where
  an OpenFastPath web server is implemented behind an ODP enabled packet filtering
  firewall. The targeted platforms are Freescale (NXP) LS2085A and Cavium's ThunderX.
