excerpt: Previous introductory tutorials on LAVA have focussed on virtual platforms.
  This is an end-to-end tutorial as a basis to evaluate LAVA with one or more embedded
  targets using U-Boot. It integrates both a physical bootloader device with a stand-alone
  installation of LAVA, along with a simple PDU for target power control which is
  based on off-the-shelf Arduino components and fully integrated with pdudaemon. It
  covers device requirements, device configuration for 32- and 64-bit platforms, use
  of lavatool, tftp, pduclient and logging via the LAVA web interface and /var.
