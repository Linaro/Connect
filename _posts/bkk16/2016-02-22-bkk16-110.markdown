excerpt: "Smart connected devices such as mobile phones, tablets and Digital TVs are
  required to handle data with strong security and confidentiality requirements. A
  \u201CTrusted Execution Environment\u201D (TEE) provides an environment for processing
  data securely, protected from normal platform applications. This talk is intended
  as an introduction to Trusted Execution, and the open-source Trusted Execution Environment
  OP-TEE in particular. It introduces the GlobalPlatform TEE Specifications, explains
  how Trusted Execution is implemented by Arm TrustZone and OP-TEE, and outlines how
  trusted boot software manages the secure boot of an Arm platform. Finally, it gives
  some pointers on how to get started with OP-TEE."

Smart connected devices such as mobile phones, tablets and Digital TVs are required to handle data with strong security and confidentiality requirements. A “Trusted Execution Environment” (TEE) provides an environment for processing data securely, protected from normal platform applications. This talk is intended as an introduction to Trusted Execution, and the open-source Trusted Execution Environment OP-TEE in particular. It introduces the GlobalPlatform TEE Specifications, explains how Trusted Execution is implemented by Arm TrustZone and OP-TEE, and outlines how trusted boot software manages the secure boot of an Arm platform. Finally, it gives some pointers on how to get started with OP-TEE.
