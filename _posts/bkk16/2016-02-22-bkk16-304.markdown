excerpt: 'AArch64 and Arm GDB ports were added some years ago, but some useful features
  are still missing.  We started to add these features to GDB in 2015 and most of
  them are already accepted by the GDB mainline.


  This presentation will discuss these new added features, such as reverse debugging,
  tracepoint, and multi-arch debugging, together with some explanations on how does
  GDB support them in general.


  This presentation will also introduce some basic GDB or debugger internal knowledges
  and also some GDB in-progress projects in which we plan to do and are interested
  in.'
