excerpt: Generating a specific power model for the platform is a pre-requirement for
  delpoying EAS and IPA. This makes understanding power models and how to generate
  parameters for them a useful skill. In this session we demonstrate how to use workload
  automation to gather power data from a board. We will then describe how to derive
  rough values for the EAS and IPA power models using nothing but this easily observable
  data. We will not rely on any information provided by OEM or SoC vendor.
