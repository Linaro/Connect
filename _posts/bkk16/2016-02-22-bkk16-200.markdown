excerpt: "Trust and security are essential for the Internet of Things (IoT) to scale.
  As your product becomes successful, attraction will be high for it to be hacked
  and, as a consumer, you'll suffer with consequences if security is not baked into
  the system, at every level. With IoT, we now need to enable an appropriate level
  of security for sub $1 IoT designs done by people with little or no security expertise.
  In this presentation, you will learn how Arm, Linaro and the Arm partnership are
  securing these sub $1 IoT endpoints by providing device security, lifecycle security
  and communication security, without the need for in-depth security experts\u2026"
