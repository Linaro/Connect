excerpt: 'The concept of Enterprise Firmware is a fairly new one for ARM, and pretty
  much started in LEG, while ARM Ltd. was still focusing on mobile platforms. Also,
  in parallel, several partners did their own work internally without sharing, resulting
  in multiple implementations of what should be a standard platform. To make our partners
  successful, we need to help them - by leading through example - to get more done.


  This talk covers both the commercial importance of aligning the ecosystem and some
  of the technical challenges to overcome, and what ARM and Linaro are planning to
  do about it.'

The concept of Enterprise Firmware is a fairly new one for ARM, and pretty much started in LEG, while ARM Ltd. was still focusing on mobile platforms. Also, in parallel, several partners did their own work internally without sharing, resulting in multiple implementations of what should be a standard platform. To make our partners successful, we need to help them - by leading through example - to get more done.  This talk covers both the commercial importance of aligning the ecosystem and some of the technical challenges to overcome, and what ARM and Linaro are planning to do about it.
