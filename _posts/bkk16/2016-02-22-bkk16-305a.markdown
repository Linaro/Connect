excerpt: 'The Armv8 Server Lab has been up and running for more than a year since
  the inception in the late Fall of 2014 and helped continuously those who need server-grade
  hardware to verify their software, from the kernel to user applications.


  In this BoF at BKK16, the Server Lab users get together for the first time to review
  what we have accomplished so far and share knowledge obtained from our experiences
  in the Lab. Constructive feedback from the users should shape the direction of the
  Lab in the coming months of 2016. The BoF structure is as follows: possibly a few
  short talks from the users, 10-15 minutes each, will be given after the introductory
  address of the status of the Lab from the managers, followed by a discussion between
  the attendees.'
