excerpt: Running Linux in EL2 offers potentially important performance benefits for
  running VMs at the cost of more complicated low-level code paths in the kernel and
  worse performance for userspace applications.  This talk explores the required actions
  taken so far, an analysis of the benefits, and discusses challenges with upstreaming
  this approach.
