excerpt: Compilers such as GCC may use undefined behaviour in language specifications
  to generate efficient code (especially newer recent versions). The rules for undefined
  behaviour can be subtle and programming mistakes can lead to correctness and/or
  security issues. This presentation will examine issues resulting from undefined
  behavior in applications.  It will also discuss the position of the relevant  language
  standards and address what compilers can do to exploit the standard in order to
  generate optimized code. We will also look at tools that can help us in detecting
  undefined behaviours so that these correctness issues can be prevented.
