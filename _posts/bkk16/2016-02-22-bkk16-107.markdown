excerpt: The Budget Fair Queue (BFQ) I/O scheduler in the Linux block layer is a new
  heuristic approach to improving user-perceived latencies in block accessible media
  such as hard disks, SSD and (e)MMC and SD cards. Linaro is investing and helping
  in pushing this development ahead. The session describes what the BFQ patch set
  does and how.
