excerpt: The RP Enterprise Kernel is the combination of Reference Platform topic branches.  The
  goal is that, members of Linaro will in combination contribute to a kernel branch
  that incorporates the activities and development of all members.   The topics will
  be targeted towards tip, and rebased once the kernel has moved from rc to stable.  As
  in, if the current RC is for 4.4, then all topics will be based on that kernel.  Once
  the 4.4 kernel is released, all patches that were not accepted into the kernel release,
  will be rebased to the next developement kernel.  In the case of this example, rebase
  from 4.4 to 4.5.
