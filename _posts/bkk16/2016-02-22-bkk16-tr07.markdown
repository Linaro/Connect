excerpt: The complexity of the tools and working environments is very high in IT area,
  especially in software engineering field. Thanks to Linux's freedom of choice and
  flexibility it gets even higher. Due to the amount of time needed for learning all
  those bits of technology, it is not practically possible to set up an ideal workspace
  without talking to others and learning the results of their research. So, let's
  come together and discuss hardware/software setups for our workspaces and learn
  from each other.
