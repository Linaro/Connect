excerpt: 'The arm64 port is now in pretty good shape with most things ported and

  built in distros. However we know that there is plenty of software

  that is not optimised and some may not actually work at all. Please

  come along and moan about anything you have found which doesn''t work

  as well on arm64 as it does on x86. We (Linaro, Arm and Debian) want

  your feedback on where to direct effort next.'

The arm64 port is now in pretty good shape with most things ported and built in distros. However we know that there is plenty of software that is not optimised and some may not actually work at all. Please come along and moan about anything you have found which doesn't work as well on arm64 as it does on x86. We (Linaro, Arm and Debian) want your feedback on where to direct effort next.
