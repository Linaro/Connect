excerpt: Linaro has multiple labs and board farms with varying purposes. This session
  will start with an overview of each of these, their locations, their focus, etc.
  It will then provide examples and direction on how a Member can add their hardware
  to a board farm. It will also provide an overview of how a Member or employee can
  navigate/leverage/check out a board for experimentation and usage (this varies based
  upon which lab/board farm is being considered, so all will be reviewed) in each
  of the farm locations. Finally, the session will provide pointers to any respective
  documentation, user guides, etc. for each of the locations.
