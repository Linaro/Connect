excerpt: 'The presentation will continue from where Benchmarking Best Practices 101
  left off, covering the topics of benchmark reproducibility and reporting in more
  depth.


  An experiment is reproducible if external teams can run the same experiment over
  large periods of time and get comparable results. Clear, concise reporting allows
  others to utilise benchmark results.'
