excerpt: 'The current Hadoop ecosystem is challenged and slowed by fragmented and
  duplicated efforts.


  An industry standard is required that translates to immediate benefits that will
  increase stability, capabilities and compatibility among Hadoop distributions. Its
  also important to include an open data management core with emphasis on making it
  enterprise focused.


  The ODPi is a shared industry effort focused on build such standards and also promoting
  and advancing the state of Big Data technologies. Linaro is actively involved in
  this effort and also to make sure ODPi is ARM compatible.


  This talk will go over some of specifications defined, Linaro''s contributions,
  Roadmap and a quick demo'
