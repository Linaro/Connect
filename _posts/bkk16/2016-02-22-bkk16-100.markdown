excerpt: The Reference Software Platform lead project was introduced in Linaro Connect
  San Francisco 2015, and since then it evolved and matured with the completion of
  the first tree big milestones (the 15.10, 15.12 and 16.03 releases). This session
  will revisit the work done as part of the previous releases, covering the projects
  that were incorporated through the process and our vision for the future milestones.
