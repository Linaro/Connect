excerpt: Two-factor authentication (2fa) increases the security of a password (something
  you know) by adding the extra factor of something you have. In Google's implementation,
  this takes the form of a phone that receives text messages. This session will explain
  how to set up two-factor authentication on Google, how it works and what to do if
  something goes wrong.
