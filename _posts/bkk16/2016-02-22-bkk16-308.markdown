excerpt: "ATOS is an Auto Tuning Optimization System that is able to find automatically
  the best performance/size tradeoff from a build system and a training application.
  The input of ATOS tools are a build command and a run command. From the build command,
  ATOS will infer an internal build configuration that it will run with different
  sets of compiler options. These build configurations are executed with the run command
  from which code size and performance will be extracted.\n   From the set of build
  configurations that ATOS explores, one can extract the preferred trade-off between
  code size and performance. The extracted build configuration can be archived and
  replayed later in order to generate the optimized executable without any modification
  into the initial build system.\n    The nice property of ATOS is that NO modification
  of the sources or the makefiles are needed. ATOS can work on any large/deep project,
  as soon as the compiler used is gcc or LLVM under Linux."

ATOS is an Auto Tuning Optimization System that is able to find automatically the best performance/size tradeoff from a build system and a training application. The input of ATOS tools are a build command and a run command. From the build command, ATOS will infer an internal build configuration that it will run with different sets of compiler options. These build configurations are executed with the run command from which code size and performance will be extracted.    From the set of build configurations that ATOS explores, one can extract the preferred trade-off between code size and performance. The extracted build configuration can be archived and replayed later in order to generate the optimized executable without any modification into the initial build system.     The nice property of ATOS is that NO modification of the sources or the makefiles are needed. ATOS can work on any large/deep project, as soon as the compiler used is gcc or LLVM under Linux.
