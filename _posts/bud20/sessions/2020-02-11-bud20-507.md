description: WarpDrive is a framework that accessing hardware accelerator in user
  space. Introduce the framework in the user space.<br>WarpDrive is based on IOMMU
  SVA (Shared Virtual Address) Technology. It can share the same virtual address between
  CPU and accelerator. It could avoid to expose physical address to vendor driver
  in user space. It could also avoid to copy memory in vendor driver that is in user
  space.<br>There're two main parts in WarpDrive User Space. One is libwd that provides
  the ability to access UACCE that is the kernel part in WarpDrive. Vendor driver
  in user space could access memory mapping from UACCE by libwd. And the other part
  is algorithm library.<br>If vendor driver isn't common to do the generalization
  and abstraction, it has to provide an interface to apps. If vendor driver is common,
  then the interface of vendor driver is integrated in algorithm library. So apps
  could access either customize interface in special vendor driver or general interface
  in algorithm library.
