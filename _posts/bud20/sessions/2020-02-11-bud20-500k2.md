description: Lord Kelvin said "if you can't measure it, you cannot improve it". That
  may only be partially true. Instead, I reckon we must understand measurements and
  their context to comprehend what is going. In the context of software development,
  this would mean that we must measure the who, what, when, and how related to software
  development processes, but also know the context around this data to be able to
  answer the questions that allow managers to drive projects to their goals. I call
  it the “measurements in context” principle.<br><br>This talk demonstrates this principle
  with humor by looking at Linaro’s projects. Let’s explore together what the software
  development analytics data shows us about Linaro’s open source projects. Then, let’s
  guess at what this could be telling us if we had no idea about Linaro. Finally,
  let’s apply the “measurements in context” principle to get sensible insights.<br><br>This
  fun talk does not intend to answer real questions about Linaro, however, it does
  show in an approachable and memorable way how to do analytics on open source software.
  We will stumble in this presentation together over common problems only so you don’t
  have to do it when it really matters. Lessons learned from the CHAOSS project will
  also provide a solid foundation from which you can build your own analysis.<br><br>During
  this talk, I will present an approach to drive your software development using data
  from both strategical and tactical points of view. Everything will rely on existing
  free, open source tools and knowledge from communities like CHAOSS (Community Health
  Analytics for Open Source Software) and InnerSource Commons.
