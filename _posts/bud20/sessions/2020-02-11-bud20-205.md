description: The Linux crypto subsystem has a poor reputation when it comes to usability
  of its API. This is not entirely undeserved, but it makes sense to take a closer
  look at why the current API was designed the way it is and what we are doing to
  improve it. Also, we'll take a look at some examples of how a better understanding
  of the underlying crypto on the part of the crypto API user would have resulted
  in much better (and more secure) code.

- speaker_bio: Ard Biesheuvel is employed by Arm Ltd. to contribute to open source
    projects such as Tianocore and the Linux kernel. His mission is to make security
    and hardening features that exist for other architectures equally well supported
    on ARM, or better. His contributions to the arm64 Linux kernel cover things like
    KASLR, per-task stack cookies and most of the accelerated crypto code.
