- speaker_bio: Iâ€™m a chief researcher in the systems group at NEC Laboratories Europe
    in Heidelberg, Germany. My main research and work interests lie in the areas of
    high-performance software systems, and in particular specialization, virtualization,
    and the application of machine learning techniques to tackle open problems in
    the systems area. Previously, I received an undergraduate degree with honours
    from the University of Virginia, a Masters in Data Communications, Networks and
    Distributed Systems from University College London (top of the class), and a Ph.D.
    also from UCL. I have published on several top-tier conferences and journals such
