description: AI workloads are increasingly moving to the edge for performance, data
  locality and even privacy reasons. Standard ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow)
  and general-purpose OSes and distributions (e.g., Linux/Ubuntu) provide great functionality,
  but consume a significant amount of the limited resources of IoT/edge devices. In
  this presentation we will introduce a system able to take standard ML framework
  scripts and automatically generate a purpose-built stack and operating system to
  run them extremely efficiently on ARM64 IoT devices; a MobilNet deployment, for
  instance, can run with as little as 25MB including the trained network and underlying
  operating system. The presentation will further show a live demo of the system.

- speaker_bio: Iâ€™m a chief researcher in the systems group at NEC Laboratories Europe
    in Heidelberg, Germany. My main research and work interests lie in the areas of
    high-performance software systems, and in particular specialization, virtualization,
    and the application of machine learning techniques to tackle open problems in
    the systems area. Previously, I received an undergraduate degree with honours
    from the University of Virginia, a Masters in Data Communications, Networks and
    Distributed Systems from University College London (top of the class), and a Ph.D.
    also from UCL. I have published on several top-tier conferences and journals such
    as SOSP, SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, and SIGCOMM CCR and regularly act as TPC member
    of conferences and journals such as IMC , INFOCOM, CoNEXT and SIGCOMM CCR.
