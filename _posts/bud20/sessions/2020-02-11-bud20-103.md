description: As a very emerging architecture in the enterprise market, Arm64 is quite
  popular among developers. For filling the gaps of hard approaching for common developers,
  Linaro Developer Cloud has opened for several years to accelerate arm64 based workload
  development.<br /> Linaro Developer Cloud is a purely open-source cloud on Arm64,
  which used to be a VM based cloud just offering VM instances. During the last half-year,
  we've done some work to make it embrace Kubernetes, while now it can offer Kubernetes
  as a service. <br /> In this session, we will general introduce Linaro Developer
  Cloud, as well as elaborate on the structure of the arm64 open-source cloud, and
  the efforts to support Kubernetes as a service both from the infrastructure level
  and Kubernetes cloud provider side. On top of that, we will share future development
  directions/
