- speaker_bio: Adrian is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and is migrating
    processes at least since 2010. He started to migrate processes in a high performance
    computing environment and at some point he migrated so many processes that he
    got a PhD for that. Most of the time he is now migrating containers but occasionally
    he still migrates single processes.
