description: During this presentation I will provide an overview and necessary details
  on how to run containers in HPC environments using Podman. Podmanâ€™s daemonless and
  rootless fork()+exec() architecture is a perfect fit for HPC environments and can
  also be used in other secure or restricted environments without setuid privileges.<br
  /> <br /> I will also give an introduction to OpenHPC and the latest 2.0 release
  that is based on RHEL 8 and supports aarch64. At the conclusion, I will demonstrate
  how to deploy containerized applications under the control of Open MPI (mpirun).

- speaker_bio: Adrian is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and is migrating
    processes at least since 2010. He started to migrate processes in a high performance
    computing environment and at some point he migrated so many processes that he
    got a PhD for that. Most of the time he is now migrating containers but occasionally
    he still migrates single processes.
