description: 'This session provides an in-depth overview of the new Server Base Security
  Guide (SBSG) released by Arm in Fall 2019. SBSG provides guidance for securing the
  platform (firmware/hardware) layer of SBSA/SBBR systems (servers as well as edge
  devices). The session will focus on the key areas that must be addressed to secure
  the firmware and hardware of Arm A-class systems, including: hardware security requirements,
  verified boot, TPMs and measured-boot, UEFI security, and secure firmware update.
  How SBSG relates to other security standards from NIST, Trusted Computing Group,
  and Arm will also be covered.'
