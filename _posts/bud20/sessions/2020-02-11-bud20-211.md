description: SmartNICs are a transformational technology that enables entirely new
  capabilities to enterprise, datacenter, edge and hyperscaler architectures. SmartNICs
  evolved from networking-only devices to offering networking, storage, and security
  features. The evolution of SmartNICs is now entering the next phase. A modern SmartNIC
  integrates significant CPU resources – 8 or 16 Arm CPUs are common. These CPUs enable
  new use-cases when general-purpose compute can also be executed on a SmartNIC.<br><br>Arm
  is contributing to this phase of SmartNIC evolution by partnering with the ecosystem
  to ease software development for SmartNICs – and thus evolving towards SmartNIC-as-a-platform
  (SNAAP) The goal of this partnership is to build an ecosystem for developers to
  easily use SmartNICs and leverage general-purpose compute on modern SmartNICs platform.
  We describe the SNAAP project and the new use-cases for general purpose compute
  on SmartNICs with examples.
