description: LAVA (a distributed test framework) is widely used in the Open Source
  community for testing. It is also catching up fast in the Industry. NXP is a leading
  company whose has a wide portfolio of ARM processor boards. NXP has a Public LAVA
  server that is used by LKFT to run various Linux kernel tests on NXP boards.<br><br>LAVA
  is traditionally supported on Debian and more recently a Docker image is available
  that can run on any<br>architecture and operating system.<br><br>The demo aims to
  run LAVA on ARM based platform (LX2160(Server)/ LS1046(Dispatcher)) there by providing<br>an
  end-to-end ARM solution (LAVA-IN-A-BOX). Another goal of the demo is to manage such
  a deployment<br>using any cloud orchestration (for example, NXPâ€™s EdgeScale) to
  securely manage devices and applications.<br><br>The main advantage is that although
  LAVA is deployed globally, maintenance of Servers and Dispatchers can be managed
  securely from a central location thereby significantly reducing the cost and time
  for companies.
