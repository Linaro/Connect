description: The ARM SCMI specification provides a standardized interface for OS/Firmware
  coordinated power management. SCMI has been adopted today for platforms primarily
  targeted at the mobile/client/embedded segment. As Arm-based SoCs increasingly find
  their way into Infrastructure and Automotive, standardizing Power Management in
  products targeted at these segments becomes a necessity to prevent software fragmentation.<br
  /> <br /> In this session we will explore how SCMI can be extended to standardize
  power management for Arm-based SoCs targeted at Infrastructure and Automotive. We
  will look at how SCMI can work through ACPI which is commonly used in most kernels
  targeted at the Infrastructure space. We would also have a look at how an Automotive
  Power Management stack can be setup with the help of SCMI.
