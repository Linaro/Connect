description: Android phones with Armv8.1+ features are in the market for over a year
  now and LCG ART team has been optimising ART compiler with Armv8.x features. However,
  without hardware support and proper emulator tools, it can be very challenging for
  both downstream develop and and upstream project (Google AOSP) to develop/debug/test
  our Armv8.x optimisation patches.<br /> <br /> In this presentation, we will share
  our solution of integrating VIXL simulator in Android Runtime. VIXL simulator can
  simulate any instruction emitted by the VIXL A64 assembler on x86 and ARM platforms.
  It is configurable and provide debugging features like register tracing. With this
  simulator, our developers and upstream project (ART) owners can easily debug and
  test Armv8.x new features, and improve ART compiler development productivity. <br
  /> <br /> We'll present:<br /> - Some cool features of VIXL simulator.<br /> - How
  to develop compiler optimisations with VIXL standalone simulator.<br /> - Integrate
  VIXL simulator in ART.<br /> - ART debugging & testing enhancements with such simulator
  solution.
