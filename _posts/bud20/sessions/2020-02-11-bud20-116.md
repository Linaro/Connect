description: 'Android developers are facing a common problem: how to test our applications
  on many devices without sacrificing too much time or money?<br /> <br /> How to
  build and test automatically our applications for each commit?<br /> How can we
  find those devices inside the company, whatever its size may be?<br /> Could there
  be a directory somewhere that lists those available devices?<br /> Could we use
  a device remotely and share it with other developers as if it were in the cloud?<br
  /> <br /> What if you could answer all these questions with the help of a low cost
  device farm that fits into a pocket? A pocket full of clouds…<br /> <br /> Poddingue,
  our proposal, aims to tackle this problem thanks to Docker, HypriotOS, Armbian,
  Gitlab CI and OpenSTF. It’s an internal solution made of OSS readily available,
  but it has not yet been publicly announced as a whole.<br /> <br /> This is a feedback
  about an idea on its way to production, a long journey full of different feelings
  : horror, happiness, suspense, boredom…<br /> <br /> Why should I come?<br /> <br
  /> This presentation won’t be too technical ; it is opened to anybody who has an
  interest into Android, exotic hardware or continuous integration, as long as you
  can stand a bad sense of humour. At the end of the talk, you should know how to
  build your own cloudy pocket farm of Android devices and how to use it to test your
  applications within your ci pipeline.<br /> <br /> And as I am cheap, you will also
  be surprised at how little money you need to build it.'
