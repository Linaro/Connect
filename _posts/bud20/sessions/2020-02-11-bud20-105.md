description: Currently, there are more and more ARM based datacenter hardware on the
  market, and their performance has been continuesly improving. Thus more and more
  users and customers starting to consider using these datacenter hardware for their
  bussiness. Big data is one of the most important area.<br /> <br /> On the contrary,
  the open source ecosystem for big data on ARM is not that perfect, most of the software
  in the big data ecosystem did not care too much about running on ARM previously,
  they did not officially tested their codes on ARM, and there are alot of unsolved
  problems. In order to make those software able to run on ARM, one have to search
  and read tons of articles to do alot of patches and build numbers of dependencies
  by their own. And once the upstream changes or upgrades, there might be new problems
  since it does not test on ARM in upstream. All these made users scared to use ARM
  for their bussiness.<br /> <br /> In order to change this situation and make the
  big data opensource ecosyste more friendly to ARM platform and its users, our team
  started by proposing adding ARM CI to those opensource projects. By doing this,
  the projects will be fully tested on ARM and all future changes will also be tested
  on ARM. And we fixed alot of problems directly in upstream, which benifits all users.
  And then, we start to perform performance comparision tests between ARM and X86,
  to give users an overview of the status. And there are also large numbers of TODOs
  in the future.<br /> <br /> In this session, you can learn the current status about
  ARM CI of Big Data ecosystem projects like Hadoop, Spark, Hbase, Flink, Storm, Kudu,
  Impala etc. and our efforts on fixing ARM related problems. We will also introduce
  our future plans.
