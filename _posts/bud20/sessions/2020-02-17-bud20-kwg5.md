description: Support for CPU cluster idle management together with deployment for
  PSCI based systems, has been merged for kernel v5.6. Piece by piece have made it
  to the upstream kernel throughout the years, introducing new features to cpuidle,
  timers and the generic PM domain subsystems, along with their governors.<br><br>This
  session briefly touches upon the new features that are available in the kernel,
  but also discusses the next steps, while we continue to work on improving idle management
  of systems with hierarchical CPU topologies, like multi-cluster SMP systems and
  heterogeneous systems.
