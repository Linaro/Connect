description: In the last five years, we have seen an explosion of open source in the
  IoT and embedded industry driven by a shift towards edge processing. Projects like
  Zephyr have grown from incubation to mainstream, addressing a growing need for common
  software infrastructure in embedded microcontroller applications that operate on
  the edge. In this talk we will take a look back at the expansion of open source
  in this industry in recent years and explore some insights into where it will go
  in the future.
