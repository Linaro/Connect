description: LoRa (Long Range) is a low power wireless technology targeted for IoT
  applications. LoRa enables long-range transmissions (more than 10 km in rural areas)
  with low power consumption through the Chirp spread- spectrum modulation technique.<br
  /> <br /> There are multiple attempts from the community for adding LoRa support
  to Zephyr RTOS. This session goes through all of the efforts taken so far, motivation,
  current status, and future plans of the Zephyr-LoRa work.<br /> <br /> References:<br
