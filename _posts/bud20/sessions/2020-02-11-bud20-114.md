description: Most of the modern SoC embed hardware bus firewall which controls access
  from and between the different processors in the system. The configuration of those
  hardware firewalls is most of the time static, custom and hidden in the early stages
  of the boot chain. STMicroelectronics is challenging this state of art and propose
  an alternative base on a new Linux framework to create a dynamic, common and open
  configuration for those hardware.
