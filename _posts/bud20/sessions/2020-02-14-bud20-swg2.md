description: PKCS#11 specification allows standard security packages like OpenSSL
  to leverage data storage and keys management in backend secure systems.<br><br>During
  this session, we will present today's state of open source implementations of PKCS#11
  tokens in OP-TEE environment. A trusted application handles the PKCS#11 services.
  A Linux use library interfaces the client application, possibly OpenSSL, with the
  trusted application. This presentation and the questions are planned for the about
  1/2h.<br><br>Afterward we propose a deep dive in the source code, to explain and
  get feedback on some implementation details.<br><br>This session is a follow-up
  of HKG18-402.
