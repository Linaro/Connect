description: 'In the architects’ minds, real time industrial applications is synonymous
  of super customized boot firmware, Linux kernel and userland, and even hardware
  specific software control loops. Embedded also comes with the idea of constant,
  sometimes complex and certainly resource consuming backports in selected LTS.<br
  /> <br /> The Linaro Edge computing group, LEDGE, is working to make this world
  much more simpler by introducing standardization where it makes sense and allowing
  hardware innovation to be fully exposed. The presentation will discuss new design
  patterns that are becoming available for industrial products:<br /> <br /> On the
  boot firmware side: securely booting a *single* Linux image on multiple platforms
  is becoming a reality. U-Boot and EDKII have been enhanced so that UEFI boot experience
  is the same for both environments. For the next cycle, we are tackling standard
  updates of firmware components with anti-brickable, anti-roll back protections.<br
  /> <br /> On the OS side: delivering a common kernel with a common userland is possible.
  Google attempt to go a step further with Project Treble should be an inspiration
  for composing agile distributions.<br /> <br /> On the applications side: in BKK19
  LEDGE demonstrated the feasibility of hardware agnostic ultra-low latency Time Sensitive
  applications with Linux without RT patches. Now, new APIs such as MxAPIs are required
  for efficient architecture agnostic symmetric multicore programming with asymmetric
  capabilities (OpenAMP). Arm Revere is also paving the way to standardizing native
  access to devices from VMs or applications: how this could affect control loops?'
