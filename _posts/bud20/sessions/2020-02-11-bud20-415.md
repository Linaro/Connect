description: Zink is OpenGL implemented on top of Vulkan, as a part of Mesa3D. This
  enables us to support desktop-grade OpenGL on mobile platforms, even when no OpenGL
  driver exists at all. Because this translation appears in user-space, this is also
  useful for virtualization-purposes; provide virtualization of Vulkan and get OpenGL
  for free.
