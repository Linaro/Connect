description: PSA (Platform Security Architecture) is an important security architecture.
  Arm has delivered the documents, specifications, API and reference implementations
  for the IoT area started from M class CPUs.<br /> Furthermore, we need to enable
  PSA in the IoT ecosystem. And help the IoT developers adopt PSA securely, quickly
  and easily. For example, integrate PSA firmware with popular RTOSes and demonstrate
  how PSA secures the IoT cloud services.<br /> TF-M is an open-source implementation
  of PSA firmware. We collaborated with the Silicon partners, RTOS/solution vendors
  and IoT cloud service providers to enable TF-M and PSA use cases in the RTOSes -
  FreeRTOS, Zephyr, RT-Thread etc. Also, in IoT cloud services - for example, the
  Secure connection (e.g. TLS) between the device and the cloud can be better protected
  by PSA Cryptography and Storage services.<br /> This presentation will show you
  the design and implementation of enabling PSA in the IoT ecosystem - what we have
  done and learnt, challenges, and the next plan. A demo is also proposed to showcase
  how to enhance the security of Amazon FreeRTOS TLS by leveraging Storage and Crypto
  services of TF-M.
