description: vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object) is a mechanism that the Linux kernel
  provides as an alternative to system calls to reduce, where meaningful, the costs
  in terms of cycles.<br /> This is possible because certain syscalls like gettimeofday()
  do not write any data and return one or more values that are provided by the kernel,
  which makes relatively safe calling them directly as a library function.<br /> Even
  if the mechanism is pretty much standard, every architecture in the last few years
  ended up implementing its own vDSO library in the architectural code.<br /> The
  purpose of this presentation is to examine the approach adopted from Linux 5.3 that
  identifies the commonalities in between the architectures and tries to consolidate
  the common code paths in a unified vDSO library.<br /> The presentation will start
  with a generic introduction of the vDSO concepts for the benefit of that part of
  the audience not familiar with them, it will proceed covering some of the design
  choices, implementation details and issues encountered during the unification and
  it will conclude with an analysis of the achievements and of the possible future
  development.
