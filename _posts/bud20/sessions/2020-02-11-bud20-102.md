description: Camera stacks have long lived in the proprietary world with a new<br
  /> implementation or significant development overhead for each platform and OS.<br
  /> libcamera has been developed throughout 2019 to provide an open-source camera<br
  /> stack to support Linux, Chrome and Android devices, in a vendor friendly<br />
  manner. This allows greater code reuse for vendors and simpler integration for<br
  /> users in embedded systems.<br /> <br /> libcamera has grown to the point where
  it provides a full framework for<br /> supporting your camera devices and interacting
  with kernel interfaces<br /> (V4L2/Media-Controller), and providing an API to integrate
  existing 3A image<br /> control algorithms and allowing new ones to be developed.<br
  /> <br /> This talk will focus on the details needed for bringing up a new platform
  with libcamera:<br /> <br /> - The Simple Pipeline handler, and how it can be used
  for basic implementations<br /> - Implementing a pipeline handler for your platform
  with custom ISP<br /> - Implementing your own Image Processing Algorithms<br />
