description: 'Debian System Images are usually generated by custom scripts around
  debootstrap. In this talk I will present debos, a tool to help create customised
  Debian system images for different environments.<br /> <br /> debos has been created
  with embedded systems in mind. Images are customised via YAML description file,
  also called recipe. debos parses recipes to generate custom Debian images. debos
  is not just for embedded: it can create virtual machine images, cloud images and
  more.<br /> <br /> Unlike alternatives, debos can be used without sysadmin capabilities.<br
  /> <br /> debos is a core component of a several Debian derivatives.'
