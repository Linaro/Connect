description: Based on the awareness we got in Connect in San Diego, we are trying
  to enable coresight tracing support in Linux for a NXP SoC. We plan to show this
  and propose a hacking session with Linaro team to debug issues and decide on next
  steps.

- speaker_bio: I am computer Science Engineering graduate with almost 18 years of
    continuous experience in Embedded systems, Linux BSP, Unix, operating system internals,
    device drivers, boot loaders, Flash, DDR, Ethernet, SATA, USB, wireless, networking,
    etc, and open source software. Very good hold on PowerPC and ARM architectures.
    Representing NXP in various open source projects of ARM ecosystem, distros and
    CIs like Linaro(LSK), Preempt RT, Yocto, SUSE..<br><br>I have been involved in
    various bring up, BSP code development and open source up-streaming of these BSPs
    for various NXP SoCs of QorIQ, Qonverge and Layerscape series. This includes MPC8323,
    MPC8360, P1020, P1010, P2020, BSC9131, BSC9132, B4860, T1040, LS2088A, LS1012A,
    LS1088A for u-boot and Linux. I have been working as software IP owner for various
    areas like TDM, ethernet, DDR, Flash controller, heterogenous systems, multicore,
    AMP, etc.<br><br>Currently playing the role of System Software architect which
    involves SoC feasibility and laying out the BSP software architecture for the
    NXP devices for wireless, networking and IoT use cases. Key areas include Platform
    software, u-boot, linux and device drivers.
