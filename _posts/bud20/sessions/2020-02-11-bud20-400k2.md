description: Civilization runs on Linux. Today, the Linux kernel powers everything<br>from
  plants, to cloud, to phones and IoT. Quality and security of the<br>kernel is critical
  for the modern world. In this talk,&nbsp;Dmitry&nbsp;will<br>describe the current
  state of the kernel quality, dynamics and<br>challenges. Then he will share some
  of the recent developments in the<br>kernel testing tools and processes and speculate
  about future tools.<br>The final part of the talk is dedicated to principles and
  approaches<br>that allow to build a scalable and cost-efficient testing process
  on<br>the example of the syzbot system, and how these approaches can be<br>extended
  to other testing systems.
