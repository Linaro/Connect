description: Possibly one of the most used Wayland compositors and yet least known
  might be Enlightenment. It is the compositor for Tizen and thus drives 100's of
  millions of TVs, Watches, Fridges and phones. It takes a different approach from
  Weston by being full featured in the compositor, yet still being lean and fast compared
  to full desktop compositor shells for desktop environments. Learn a bit about how
  all of this works, the design decisions made, their upsides and downsides and more.
