description: Rust is a modern programming language designed from its inception to
  solve whole classes of problems that contribute to safety and security vulnerabilities.
  That, without sacrificing expressiveness, programmer convenience, performance and
  inter-operability with legacy code.<br /> <br /> Today Rust is rapidly turning into
  the first choice for developing code intended to run in high performance, concurrent
  and safety critical environments. This is happening at all layers of the software
  stack including firmware, TEEs, OS kernels, web frameworks, the lot with contributions
  from all the usual (big) suspect organisations.<br /> <br /> The story of the inception,
  design, development, evolution and uptake of Rust is a very interesting tale that
  sheds light on the real problems facing programming in the large in the face of
  today's safety and security landscape.<br /> <br /> In this joint talk by Florian
  Gilcher (from Ferrous Systems and a member of the Rust language core team) and Robin
  Randhawa (from Arm, a long time friend of Linaro who focuses on the intersection
  of open source and safety) the audience will learn about the motivations and history
  of Rust, how it manages to do what it does and the plans for making Arm support
  in Rust be best in class.

- speaker_bio: Florian:<br /> <br /> Florian works for Ferrous Systems and has been
    closely involved with the evolution of Rust in his capacity as a Rust Language
    Core Team Observer and a member of the Governance working group. <br /> <br />
    Florian is a noted Rust evangelist and his lectures included in most major Rust
    events around the world are very popular. He regularly runs training workshops
    on Rust.<br /> <br /> As a part of Ferrous Systems he works with key embedded
    Rust projects running on Arm silicon.<br /> <br /> Robin:<br /> <br /> Robin works
    for Arm and dabbles in operating system stacks and systems programming languages.<br
    /> <br /> Robin is a part of Arm's system software architecture team at Cambridge,
    UK.<br /> <br /> His primary focus is open source software used in safety critical
    domains. He spends his time working with system software and hardware designers
    to find ways in which Arm's safety conscious partners can benefit from open source
    software.
