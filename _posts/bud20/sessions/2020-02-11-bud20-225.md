description: Systems with a mix of architectures on a single device are commonly found
  on embedded products nowadays, where each processor provides different functionality;
  allowing developers to achieve great performance, while minimizing power consumption
  and cost.<br>Where Linux can excel at providing driver compatibility, community
  support and availability of software packages, an RTOS such as FreeRTOS might be
  ideal to make important decisions guaranteeing maximum time to perform critical
  operations whilst requiring a smaller footprint.<br><br>Since both operating systems
  might be used on a single product, a single workflow to develop applications for
  them would be ideal, this talk will cover how, by using a meta-freertos layer and
  OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project, applications can be created (and tested) via classes
  and recipes for both FreeRTOS and Embedded Linux, along with the toolchain and an
  SDK.<br><br>To showcase its usage, a sample FreeRTOS application built along with
  a Linux image using the Yocto Project will be executed on QEMU (ARM) during the
  talk.
