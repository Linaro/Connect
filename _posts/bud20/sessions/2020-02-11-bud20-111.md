description: This presentation introduces applying Arm architectural features to VPP
  (Vector Packet Processing) to inspire other performance-sensitive software on Arm
  servers.<br /> <br /> VPP is widely deployed in Arm ecosystem, from embedded hardware
  and edge computing to cloud infrastructure and data center. VPP use-cases include
  vSwitches, vRouters, Gateways, Firewalls and Load Balancers, and support integration
  with OpenStack, Kubernetes, 5G Transport Network and SmartNIC.<br /> <br /> The
  vector processing nature of VPP sets it apart from other virtual switch/router solutions
  and provides many interesting architectural optimization opportunities.<br /> <br
  /> This presentation firstly elaborates why and how vector-based packet forwarding
  is improving the performance greatly compared with traditional scalar packet forwarding.<br
  /> <br /> Secondly, this presentation introduces our efforts on enabling Arm servers
  in VPP community CI/CD in FD.io lab, optimizing the source code and improving its
  performance with AArch64 features on Arm servers.<br /> <br /> Finally, the presentation
  addresses some challenges regarding software performance optimization with AArch64,
  as well as the prospection of deploying the new AArch64 features (SVE, Cache-Stashing)
  on Arm servers to get higher performance for VPP on Arm.
