description: Container computing has revolutionized how many industries and enterprises
  develop and deploy software and services. Recently, this model has gained traction
  in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community through enabling HPC-specific
  container runtimes. In this same trend, container-based computing paradigms have
  gained significant interest within the DOE/NNSA. This talk will provide an overview
  of the current utilization of containers on ARM. Specifically, we will detail the
  DevOps model developed recently, utilizing Docker to build containers and Singularity
  to deploy containers on supercomputing resources. We will explain how such a container
  model can aid in development and deployment of HPC applications with mission relevance
  using the Astra supercomputing system. This presentation will also detail several
  key aspects of utilizing containers on ARM resources, including an overhead evaluation,
  deployment assessment, and describe best practices for using containers for directed
  application needs.

- speaker_bio: Andrew J. Younge is a Computer Scientist in the Scalable System Software
    department at Sandia National Laboratories. Andrew currently serves as the Lead
    PI for the Supercontainers project under the DOE Exascale Computing Project and
    is a key contributor to the Astra system, the world's first supercomputer based
    on the Arm processor deployed under Sandia's Vanguard program. His research interests
    include high performance computing, virtualization, distributed systems, and energy
    efficient computing. The focus of his research is on improving the usability and
    efficiency of system software for supercomputing systems. Prior to joining Sandia,
    Andrew held visiting positions at the MITRE Corporation, the University of Southern
    California's Information Sciences Institute, and the University of Maryland, College
    Park. He received his PhD in computer science from Indiana University in 2016
    and his BS and MS in computer science from the Rochester Institute of Technology
    in 2008 and 2010 respectively.
