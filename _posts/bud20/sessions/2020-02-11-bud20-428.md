description: The On-Chip Interconnect API is included into the Linux kernel since
  v5.1. The purpose of the talk is to give an introduction of this new framework and
  explain what are the problems that it solves. The talk will describe how it can
  be used on modern SoCs to dynamically tune the network-on-chip for the most optimal
  power consumption and performance. This will include code examples from platform
  drivers, consumer drivers and device-tree bindings.
