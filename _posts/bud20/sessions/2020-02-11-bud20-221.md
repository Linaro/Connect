description: In this workshop I want to give a hands-on introduction about Podman.
  How to use Podman to create and run a container. How to interact with a container
  registry and how to get details about running containers. How to automatically start
  containers on reboot. How to checkpoint and restore (or migrate) running containers.
  In addition to running the containers as root I also want to show examples how to
  run rootless containers which makes Podman especially interesting for HPC environments.

- speaker_bio: Adrian is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and is migrating
    processes at least since 2010. He started to migrate processes in a high performance
    computing environment and at some point he migrated so many processes that he
    got a PhD for that. Most of the time he is now migrating containers but occasionally
    he still migrates single processes.
