description: Armâ€™s Secure Partition Client Interface Specification [1] defines the
  Firmware Framework of the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) in A-profile processors.<br>Depending
  on the framework configuration, OP-TEE can be deployed either as a Secure Partition
  managed by a Secure Partition Manager (SPM) executing at secure EL2, or can serve
  as an SPM for S-EL0 Secure Partitions.<br>In this session we would like to focus
  on OP-TEE as SPM; have a general discussion on the goals, options and challenges
  of creating and porting PSA services and OP-TEE TAs as Secure Partitions.<br><br>[1]
