description: This session will present a proposed technical architecture for enabling
  the dynamic configuration of heterogeneous platforms. The proposal defines extensions
  to the software management and deployment framework defined by the Open Container
  Initiative (OCI). The proposed extensions enable a standards-based method for scalable
  configuration inclusive of acceleration elements (e.g. FPGA-based accelerators,
  vector processor array accelerators, and asymmetric processing accelerator/offload
  targets (DSP, RPU)). The proposed OCI extensions would also enable greater flexibility
  in runtime software deployment on target, including “secure containers” via Xen,
  allowing each container to run as an isolated virtual machine (VM). <br /> <br />
  This standardization of configuration information will enable OCI-compliant container
  daemons to have a scalable abstraction to:<br /> (1) interpret hardware acceleration
  and VM components within an OCI package<br /> (2) understand the runtime requirements<br
  /> (3) configure a heterogeneous target as part of the application container deployment
  process<br /> <br /> The session has two goals. The first is to provide an overview
  of current proposal and collaborations around creating the extensions to the OCI
  Image Specification. The second is to discuss progress on technical prototyping
  of the OCI extensions. Both the hardware accelerator aware container and Xen secure
  container support are under discussion as potential Linaro Big Idea (LBI) projects.
