description: 'The LISA project provides a toolkit that supports regression testing
  and interactive analysis of Linux kernel behavior. LISA stands for Linux Integrated/Interactive
  System Analysis. LISAâ€™s goal is to help Linux kernel developers measure the impact
  of modifications in core parts of the kernel.<br>More information can be found at:
  https://github.com/ARM-software/lisa<br>Integration with QEMU emulator allow developers
  to test wide variety of hardware configurations including ARM architecture and complex
  NUMA topologies even without ARM hardware.<br>Our approach helps developers to cross
  compile kernel, install it on pre-configured VM and test it.<br>Our main focus is
  on kernel scheduler behavior on a complex NUMA topologies and large core counts.<br>However,
  our solution is generic and can be used for other purposes.<br>Our project can be
