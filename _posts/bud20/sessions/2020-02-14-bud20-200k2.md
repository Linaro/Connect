description: The cloud and data centre industry is extremely standardised. You can
  buy any commercial off the shelf server and expect your choice of operating system
  or variant of Linux to just work. Why isn't this the case for so many of the device
  edge and IoT devices? We need the same SBSA/SBBR standards and numerous others for
  provisioning and device management to ensure real success on the device edge in
  deployment, life cycle management and security or else we will fail!
