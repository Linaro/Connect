description: NXP is organized in multiple Business Lines developing Linux/Android
  ARM based products (IMX, Layerscape, S32). Historically, each BL and even each team
  within BLs has developed its own test automation tool. This implied high cost and
  low reusability within NXP, but also difficulties to share tests with customers.<br
  /> This talk will address the internal challenges NXP has faced to initiate convergence
  around LAVA, and will also present the solutions that were implemented.<br /> The
  presentation will also cover how NXP IMX uuu (Universal Update Utility - the IMX
  flashing tool) support is currently being added to LAVA. Supporting uuu will enable
  provisioning an IMX device from scratch, rather than relying on an already flashed
  bootloader.<br />
