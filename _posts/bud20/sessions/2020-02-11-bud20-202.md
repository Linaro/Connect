description: Designing SoCs with multiple cores improves the overall performance of
  the system but it comes with higher cost of implementation. A solution to address
  this problem is to connect two or more SoCs over a cache coherent link such that
  the number of cores in the overall system is multiplied by ‘n’ times if ‘n’ SoCs
  are interconnected. OS running on this linked-system uses the total amount of resources
  (cores and memory) from all the SoCs. Individual SoC’s resources can be separated
  in different NUMA nodes for efficient scheduling of tasks. <br /> <br /> This session
  covers how CCIX (Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators) protocol acting over
  standard PCIe transport caters for SMP Linux boot on a multi-socket SoC implementation.<br
  /> It will also provide implementation information on N1SDP (Neoverse N1 System
  Development Platform) where two N1SDP SoCs are connected over a CCIX link.<br />
  <br /> (“N1SDP is a test chip platform developed by ARM and aimed at realizing the
  high performance, scalable solution for the infrastructure workloads from cloud
  to edge.”)<br />
