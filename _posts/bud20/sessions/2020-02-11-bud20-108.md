description: Discussing the work being done to bring HardwareAddressSanitizer and
  automatic MTE instrumentation to GCC.<br /> <br /> Both of these introduce automatic
  checking of memory accesses into your code in a manner similar to ASAN. They use
  AArch64 architecture features to perform this memory checking with lower overheads.<br
  /> <br /> We will introduce the approach, highlight what has already been done in
  LLVM by engineers at Google, and discuss some of the potential difficulties in rollout
  of these features.<br /> <br /> We're especially keen to publicise the existing
  `pointer-compare` sanitizer that checks for a particular type of Undefined Behaviour
  which rarely causes problems in code without these features but can produce difficult
  to understand problems once HWASAN or MTE instrumentation is added.
