excerpt: Several instances of redundant zero/sign-extension related bugs are reported
  in GCC and Linaro bugzilla. These bugs are sources of performance/code size penalties.
  This presentation will discuss the history, design considerations, implementation,
  and performance characteristics of redundant zero/sign extension elimination in
  GCC. We will then discuss a new compiler pass that performs computation in promoted
  type mode in such a way that removes redundant zero/sign-extensions.
