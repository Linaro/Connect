excerpt:
  Several instances of redundant zero/sign-extension related bugs are reported
  in GCC and Linaro bugzilla. These bugs are sources of performance/code size penalties.
  This presentation will discuss the history, design considerations, implementation,
  and performance characteristics of redundant zero/sign extension elimination in
  GCC. We will then discuss a new compiler pass that performs computation in promoted
  type mode in such a way that removes redundant zero/sign-extensions.

## HKG15-405: Redundant zero/sign-extension elimination in GCC

Speaker: Kugan Vivekanandarajah
Date: February 12, 2015

★ Session Summary ★
Several instances of redundant zero/sign-extension related bugs are reported in GCC and Linaro bugzilla. These bugs are sources of performance/code size penalties. This presentation will discuss the history, design considerations, implementation, and performance characteristics of redundant zero/sign extension elimination in GCC. We will then discuss a new compiler pass that performs computation in promoted type mode in such a way that removes redundant zero/sign-extensions.
