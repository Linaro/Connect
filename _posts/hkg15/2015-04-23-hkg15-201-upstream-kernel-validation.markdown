excerpt: Performing kernel validation on hundreds of platforms for every merge on
  every upstream tree is a very challenging endeavor. Currently, much of this testing
  is performed by the maintainers, and/or chip vendors. The end result is that the
  validation efforts become fragmented in various locations, and the results are presented
  in different manners making it difficult to compare results. The goal of the kernelci.org
  project is to provide a uniform interface for these aggregated results. In this
  session the team will provide brief overview of the system architecture, and a walk
  through of the dashboard. A demo will provide users an example of how they may interact
  with the system. The second half of the session will be a dedicated discussions
  on next steps.
