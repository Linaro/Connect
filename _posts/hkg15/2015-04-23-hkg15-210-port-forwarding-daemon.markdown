HKG15-210: Port forwarding daemon 
--------------------------------------------------- 
Speaker: Luca Di Stefano 
Date: February 10, 2015 
--------------------------------------------------- 
★ Session Summary ★ 
We’ve had this on our todo list for a while. The idea is that we create a daemon that LAVA hacking sessions can request to set up an external port to forward in a pre-defined range directly onto the board, and then release that port back to the pool when the session has completed. Essentially this is to make the task of ssh‰Ûªing to a hack session require less people to have ssh access onto the hackbox server. This session will present a proposed design and solution, and investigate the potential security risks and possible disruption to the Lab infrastructure. We‰Ûªll also touch on potential use cases outside of hacking sessions. Key stakeholders are all hack session users (that‰Ûªs quite a list), LAVA team and Lab.
