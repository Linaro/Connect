excerpt: The beloved LAVA dispatcher is currently undergoing a transformation to become
  a lean, mean, use case supporting machine. Whilst the development is not yet complete
  the LAVA team would like to provide status on what has been completed, what is in
  progress, and what is next. Feel free to join the team for a discussion shortly
  after a brief presentation and help us define the future of the LAVA dispatcher!
