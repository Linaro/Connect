excerpt: 'Power distribution automation and serial console controller on an Arm platform.
  OpenTAC is a community project using open hardware and free software. The hardware
  combines a PDU and serial console server in a single box and removes the forest
  of cables common to any developer desk or rack. Custom design PCB with full isolation
  of power and serial, support for 5V DC power, RS232 or UART serial, gigabit ethernet
  and per-device power consumption measurement. Implemented as a beaglebone-black
  cape and available in two variants, supporting 4 or 8 device channels respectively,
  to fit into a 1U case. Can be supplied with or without case. There is space inside
  the 4 channel variant for a small Arm server (e.g. cubietruck) with a SATA drive,
  making it ideal as a desktop or demonstrator unit. http://wiki.vero-apparatus.com/OpenTAC
