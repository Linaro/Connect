excerpt: "CMEM is an API and kernel driver for managing one or more blocks of physically
  contiguous memory. It also provides address translation services (e.g. virtual to
  physical translation) and user-mode cache management APIs. \nSee : http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CMEM_Overview\nCMEM
  allows TI to share buffers between user space (Arm) and the DSP (or other remote
  processors). For Keystone, we also need the ability to allocate large (> 2GB) buffers
  from CMA.\nIn addition to managing shared data buffers for media applications, CMEM
  is used by the networking stack to get physical addresses to program hardware registers
  (new UIO capability needed?)\nThis session plans to be a presentation of TI SoC
  requirements which are currently being met by CMEM, and a discussion of how/if we
  can meet these requirements instead using UMM (cenalloc/dma-buf), DRM, CMA or other
  mainline Linux mechanisms existing or under development.\n"
