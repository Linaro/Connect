excerpt: "After an entire year of full time involvement of Linaro in the CoreSight
  area it is time to go back and look at what was accomplished, where things are,
  what worked well and where we need to improve. The presentation will start with
  a summary of what we accomplished and list features that were successfully pushed
  upstreamed. From our original planning some activities were carried out as expected,
  some had to be curbed for various reasons and other were added out of necessity.
  \n\nThe second part will concentrate on the remaining work that needs to be done
  and lay out a rough estimate of the order in which it will be addressed. ARMv8,
  power management, trace decoding and the integration of various CoreSight functionality
  with other kernel sub-systems are very high on our list of things to so. We hope
  to receive feedback from the audience on the soundness of our approach and definitely
  open to opinion or suggestions that can help make CoreSight a better sub-system
  usable by everyone."
