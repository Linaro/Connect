excerpt: 'The concept of ''time'' in Linux is encoded in many different ways, but
  the

  most common one is based on the ''time_t'' type that counts the number of

  seconds that have passed since Jan 1, 1970. This type is currently defined

  as ''long'', which on 32-bit systems is a signed 32-bit number that will

  overflow on Jan 19 2038 and likely cause all systems existing today to

  stop working.


  In our presentation, we give an introduction to range of problems that

  we see across user space and kernel, and we talk about the work that

  we are doing to address some of these issues.

★ Session Summary ★
The concept of ‘time’ in Linux is encoded in many different ways, but the most common one is based on the ‘time_t’ type that counts the number of seconds that have passed since Jan 1, 1970. This type is currently defined as ‘long’, which on 32-bit systems is a signed 32-bit number that will overflow on Jan 19 2038 and likely cause all systems existing today to stop working.
In our presentation, we give an introduction to range of problems that we see across user space and kernel, and we talk about the work that we are doing to address some of these issues.
