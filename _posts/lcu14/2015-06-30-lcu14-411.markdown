  \ -the footpath we had to follow for bootstrapping the Android port for AArch64.\
  \ In this presentation we will cover the low level implementation details as well\
  \ as a short history of our project. \n\nAt the end of the session the audience\
  \ should be ready to boot a shell only Android filesystem, run the low level tests\
  \ and start submitting patches."
