excerpt: 'Arm Linux has traditionally been the the operating system of choice for
  the very low end of embedded systems, with very low power consumption and tight
  constraints on memory size and CPU speed.


  We still support machines based on Arm7TDMI and Cortex-M3 with as little as 2MB
  of RAM, but there is a disconnect between the stagnating upstream contributions
  for systems like this and growing interest for using Linux in ultra-low power and
  low-cost scenarios like wearable

  computing or the "Internet of Things".


  In my presentation, I will talk about some of the tricks that used to scale Linux
  to the absolute low-end, such as running without an MMU or executing the kernel
  from NOR flash, and areas that could use more work, such as upstream ports for Linaro
  member platforms (STM32, Kinetis, ...) and improving kernel support for low-memory
  scenarios.


  In the discussion, I want to find out where people in the audience think we should
  be heading in Arm Linux. Are we leaving the low-end market to MIPS, ARC, Blackfin
  and MSP430 by removing support for MMU-less systems and small-memory configurations,
  or should we

  invest more time in these systems?'''

★ Session Summary ★
Arm Linux has traditionally been the the operating system of choice for the very low end of embedded systems, with very low power consumption and tight constraints on memory size and CPU speed.

We still support machines based on Arm7TDMI and Cortex-M3 with as little as 2MB of RAM, but there is a disconnect between the stagnating upstream contributions for systems like this and growing interest for using Linux in ultra-low power and low-cost scenarios like wearable
