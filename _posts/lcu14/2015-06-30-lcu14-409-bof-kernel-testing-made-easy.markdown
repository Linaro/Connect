excerpt: Testing is like ice cream, there is always room for more. We can always use
  more testing to make sure the kernel does what it needs to. Unfortunately it is
  often not easy to test the kernel without doing a bunch of setup of environment
  and getting the correct tools. This session discusses ways of making kernel tests
  easy to run without requiring a lot of effort. Gaurav Minocha will discuss the Google
  Summer of Code project on making the in-kernel device tree unit tests easier to
  run, and Grant Likely will lead a discussion on ways we can make kernel testing
  as easy as typing "make test".
