excerpt: This session is an advanced course on Linux kernel upstreaming fundamentals.
  The course covers how the arm-soc kernel tree is maintained and why that is important
  to Arm Linux kernel developers. The focus of the course is the explanation of the
  detailed mechanics of creating and posting patch series to upstream mailing lists
  for several common cases. Annotated session content is made up of previously upstreamed
  Arm support captured from emails to the kernel mailing lists. The target audience
  is both software engineers and engineering managers preparing to upstream software
  into the kernel. The topic requires a solid background in software configuration
  management terminology and the git SCM tool as well as a good technical understanding
  of the Linux kernel itself.
