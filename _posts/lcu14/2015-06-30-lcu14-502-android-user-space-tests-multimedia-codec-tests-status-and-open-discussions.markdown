excerpt: 'Android provides CTS - Compatibility Test Suite, written in java and run
  to verify the Android system. However Android has limited low-level tests, typically
  needed to port, benchmark and optimize components, in isolation. There is a need
  to create, enhance, share and deploy such user-space tests.


  In this discussion, Ashok will cover recent work on multimedia codec tests for AArch64
  done by Arm and Linaro, provide a quick overview on current Android user space tests,
  being run as part of Linaro''s monthly release. This will be followed by an open
  discussio'
