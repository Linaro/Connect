excerpt: This session will provide an overview of the foundations of a multi-arch
  compiler driver and discuss necessary support in GCC, LLVM, multi-arch enablement
  (in both), and bug reporting. The eventual goal of a unified driver will be a compiler
  driver that has a common set of feature flags that can invoke the desired compiler,
  which will then generate consistent results between compilers.

★ Session Summary ★
This session will provide an overview of the foundations of a multi-arch compiler driver and discuss necessary support in GCC, LLVM, multi-arch enablement (in both), and bug reporting. The eventual goal of a unified driver will be a compiler driver that has a common set of feature flags that can invoke the desired compiler, which will then generate consistent results between compilers.
