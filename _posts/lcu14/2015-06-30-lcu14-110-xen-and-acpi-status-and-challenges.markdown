excerpt: In this development and hacking session, we will be working out development
  issues relating to the developing a prototype of running the Xen hypervisor and
  Dom0 on platforms with only ACPI support. Supporting Xen on ACPI platforms is particularly
  challenging, because the Xen hypervisor consumes parts of the ACPI data and accesses
  a few hardware resources, whereas Dom0 accesses the remaining hardware resources
  and accesses the rest of the ACPI data, but cannot access all of the hardware. This
  session is targeted at developers actively working on ACPI and/or Xen, and we will
  be discussing current development challenges and specifically validate the feasibility
  of using the _STA methods to override hardware descriptors consumed or modified
  by Dom0.
