excerpt: OP-TEE (Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment) is the source code for
  the TEE in Linux using the ARM Trustzone technology. This component meets the Global

  a number of platform specific characteristics are addressed, such as memory layout
  or board specific hardware IP. In this session, you can learn the steps to follow
  to port OP-TEE for your armv7 platform, as the ones that have been defined when
  porting OP-TEE to A80 (SWG-77). OP-TEE to the Allwinner A80 platform
