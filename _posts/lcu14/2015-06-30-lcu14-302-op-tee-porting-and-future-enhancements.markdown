  the TEE in Linux using the Arm Trustzone technology. This component meets the Global

  or board specific hardware IP. In this session, you can learn the steps to follow
  to port OP-TEE for your armv7 platform, as the ones that have been defined when
  porting OP-TEE to A80 (SWG-77). OP-TEE to the Allwinner A80 platform
