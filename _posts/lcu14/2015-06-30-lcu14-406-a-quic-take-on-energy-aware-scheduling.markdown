excerpt: 'Task scheduling on big.Little targets is a known challenge in the community.
  A commercial grade solution exists with Arm''s Global Task Scheduler and there is
  a second solution being developed by Arm to solve this problem in a more generic,
  upstream-friendly way. The HMP scheduler extensions developed at Qualcomm Innovation
  Center (QuIC) were created to achieve many of the same benefits being sought in
  the power-aware scheduler in current development upstream, along with perhaps some
  additional ones. This presentation will cover the features, design and status of
  QuIC''s HMP scheduler extensions.


  Some areas of interest from Arm-Linaro perspective:

  - Some intro to their target arch/platform.

  - Architecture of their software solution (sched, load tracking algorithm, power-
  management from the scheduler, energy model description and use, DT etc).

  - Pain points from an upstream integration PoV.

  - Results, if any.'

★ Session Summary ★
Task scheduling on big.Little targets is a known challenge in the community. A commercial grade solution exists with Arm's Global Task Scheduler and there is a second solution being developed by Arm to solve this problem in a more generic, upstream-friendly way. The HMP scheduler extensions developed at Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) were created to achieve many of the same benefits being sought in the power-aware scheduler in current development upstream, along with perhaps some additional ones. This presentation will cover the features, design and status of QuIC's HMP scheduler extensions.

Some areas of interest from Arm-Linaro perspective:
- Some intro to their target arch/platform.
- Architecture of their software solution (sched, load tracking algorithm, power- management from the scheduler, energy model description     and use, DT etc).
- Pain points from an upstream integration PoV.
- Results, if any.
