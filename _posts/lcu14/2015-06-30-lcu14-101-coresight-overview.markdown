excerpt: Coresight is the name given to a set of IP blocks providing hardware assisted
  tracing for Arm based SoCs. This presentation will give an introduction to the technology,
  how it works and offer a glimpse of the capabilities it offers. More specifically
  we will go over the components that are part of the architecture and how they are
  used. Next will be presented the framework Linaro is working on in an effort to
  provide consolidation and standardization of interfaces to the coresight subsystem.
  We will conclude with a status of our current upstreaming efforts and how we see
  the coming months unfolding.
