excerpt: This session will provide an update on the status of the LLVMLinux project;
  a project which is cooperating with both the Linux kernel and LLVM communities to
  build the Linux kernel with Clang/LLVM. This talk will also cover new things in
  LLVM which make clang even more attractive to the kernel community. LLVM is an extensive
  compiler technology suite which is already commonplace from Android/Renderscript
  and OpenCL through to high performance computing clusters.
