**Keynote Title:** Complex Made Simple: The State of Governance in Open Source

**Keynote Abstract:** Clear governance, a shared understanding of process and rules, is key to the success of open source adoption at scale. Our global community represents many perspectives, many cultures and many jurisdictions. To address these we have seen the emergence of overarching principles, practical guides and effective tools that support the necessary balance of flexibility and shared trust. This talk will focus in the key open source solutions that address real world challenges. It will highlight a stack of solutions that includes OpenChain, SPDX, Reuse.Software, FOSSology, ScanCode, sw360 and QuarterMaster and explain how they work together from meta level (e.g OpenChain standard) to practical process implementation (e.g QuarterMaster CI/CD).
