**Title:** Swarms 2.0 – The Living Network of Everyone and Everything
**Date:** Friday 29th September 2017
**Time:** 8:45 - 9:15

### Jan M. Rabaey
Around 2010, the Berkeley Ubiquitous SwarmLab was formed focusing on the transformational
opportunities offered by trillions of networked motor-sensory nodes distributed throughout our
physical world. To enable the full potential of the sensory swarm, we realized that a degree of
virtualization was necessary enabling applications to be developed and deployed on an
abstracted model of the hardware platform, while still being able to provide real-time
guarantees. Many of these concepts are now migrating into the commercial and industrial
domain.
A new leap forward is about to happen. Advances in every aspect of information technology
enable entities such as robots, drones and UAVs to becoming more ubiquitous, and efficient,
enabling them to interact more effectively with each other and/or with humans. These networks
of everyone and everything create entirely new options in so many areas such as augmented
reality, tactile inter-networking, distributed manufacturing and smart cities. To go even one step
further, the miniaturization of motor-sensory functions enables the swarm to encompass the
human body (“The Human Intranet”) opening the potential of true augmentation, and
fundamentally changing how we humans interact with ourselves and with the world around us.
Turning these opportunities into reality requires progress on so many different fronts as will be
outlined in the presentation.


# Biography – Jan M. Rabaey


Jan holds the Donald O. Pederson Distinguished Professorship at the University of California at
Berkeley. He is a founding director of the Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC) and the
Berkeley Ubiquitous SwarmLab, and has served as the Electrical Engineering Division Chair at
Berkeley twice.
Prof. Rabaey has made high-impact contributions to a number of fields, including advanced
wireless systems, low power integrated circuits, sensor networks, and ubiquitous computing. His
current interests include the conception of the next-generation integrated wireless systems, as well
as the exploration of the interaction between the cyber and the biological world.
He is the recipient of major awards, amongst which the IEEE Mac Van Valkenburg Award, the
European Design Automation Association (EDAA) Lifetime Achievement award, the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) University Researcher Award, and the IEEE Aristotle
Award. He is an IEEE Fellow, a member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Sciences and Arts of
Belgium, and has received honorary doctorates from Lund (Sweden), Antwerp (Belgium) and
Tampere (Finland). He has been involved in a broad variety of start-up ventures.
