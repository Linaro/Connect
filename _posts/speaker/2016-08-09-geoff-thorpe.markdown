**Title: IoT Zephyr**
**Date: Wednesday, September 28**
**Time: 8:55am – 9:35am**

Geoff Thorpe heads up security within the Microcontroller group of NXP, where the intersection of device security and network security gives him a headache commonly known as “IoT”. His early experience with security topics was very software-centric, as a long-standing member of the OpenSSL team and a contributor to related open source projects. After many years veering off into semiconductors and hardware architecture, his software-bias has been domesticated to some extent but not eradicated.
