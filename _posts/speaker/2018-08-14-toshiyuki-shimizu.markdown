**Company:** Fujitsu Limited

**Job Title**: Vice President, System Development Div., Next Generation Technical Computing Unit

**Bio** :
Mr. Shimizu started at Fujitsu Laboratories with the research and development of the AP1000
massively parallel supercomputer system, and he has been deeply and continuously involved in the
development of scalar parallel supercomputers, large SMP enterprise servers, and x86 cluster
systems. His primary research interest is in interconnect architecture, most recently culminating in
the development of the Tofu interconnect for the K computer and PRIMEHPC series.
He leads the development of Fujitsu’s high-end supercomputer PRIMEHPC series and the Post-K
supercomputer.

Mr. Shimizu received his Masters of Computer Science degree from Tokyo Institute of Technology in
1988.

**Keynote Title:** A new powerful general purpose CPU complements and accelerates Arm ecosystem prosperity in high performance servers

**Keynote Abstract:** 

A new Fujitsu designed powerful Arm general purpose CPU will be presented. It supports Armv8-A
and 512-bit SVE, scalable vector extension, ensuring binary compatibility amongst other Arm
processors. It also provides superior memory bandwidth for real application performance by utilizing
the on-package stacked memories. The CPU realizes the scalable energy efficient system since it is
implemented as a system-on-a-chip integrating the interconnect, known as TofuD. The post-K
featuring the CPU is under developing with RIKEN targeting the hundredfold of application
performance of the K computer. The system also maintains binary compatibility standards, such as
SBSA, SBBR, which contributes to complement and accelerate Arm ecosystem prosperity supporting
of system software development including optimizing compilers, libraries, and tools. In the
presentation, preliminary performance evaluation results and Fujitsu’s activities for prosperity of the
Arm HPC ecosystem will be also discussed.
