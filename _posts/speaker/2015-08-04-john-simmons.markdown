**Title:** The Web and Digital Rights Management – the technical solution to the Web-DRM paradox and its disruptive implications
**Date:** Tuesday, September 22
**Time:** 9:20am - 9:50am
  

John Simmons is the visionary who inspired Microsoft to play a leadership role in the creation of international media standards. In a 2008 internal memo John envisioned a RESTful, interoperable commercial media stack, predicting its impact on the Web. His efforts resulted in Microsoft publishing specs for DRM-interoperable encoding and adaptive streaming, which in turn culminated in the ISO MPEG standards for Common Encryption and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). He led the creation of an OAuth 2.0 TV Everywhere authorization standard, initiated the Google-Microsoft-Netflix contributions to W3C for HTML5 Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) and Media Source Extensions (MSE) and authored an open spec to enable embedded browsers to implement EME without the use of proprietary software. At present John is the Media Platform Architect for Microsoft’s Operating System Group.
