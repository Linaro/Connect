**Title:** Multi-core CPU and server
**Date:** Tuesday 26th September 2017
**Time:** 9:15 – 9:45

SynQuacer is an Arm® based CPU chip developed by Socionext. It contains 24 cores of
Cortex™-A53. The SynQuacer processor is an ideal foundation for low-cost, highly-integrated
and power-efficient server systems deployed to handle edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT)
data processing and cloud service applications.

SynQuacer can easily scale to handle increasing task loads over time. Multiple CPUs, up to 64,
can be connected through the Socionext DDT (Direct Data Transaction) with the possibility of
connecting more nodes.

At this event, Linaro, GIGABYTE and Socionext have jointly built a software development
environment that complies with Linaro's 96Boards open hardware specification using
SynQuacer. This partnership of three industry leaders makes SynQuacer your number one
choice of 64bit architecture development environment.
