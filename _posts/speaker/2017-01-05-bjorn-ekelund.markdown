**Title: Human communication, a niche use case in 5G**
**Date: Wednesday, March 8**
**Time: 8.30-9.10am**



The fifth generation mobile communications network (5G) is not your "traditional telecom network" but optimized for connected and intelligent machines, having distributed cloud capacity and supporting devices ranging from gigabits per second to multi-year battery life. Software, connectivity and digitalization are reshaping both industries and society at an ever increasing rate and 5G is a strong catalyst. This keynote will explore this development, including how products and services are revolutionized and how many of today's value chains are being overthrown.
