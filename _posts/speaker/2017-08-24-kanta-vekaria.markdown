**Title: **High Performance Computing: Where is it going?
**Date: **Tuesday 26th September 2017
**Time: **8:45 - 9:15

**Abstract:**

Arm has entered the HPC market and this talk introduces the good work that Linaro is doing, the challenges faced in this market and more interestingly its futures.

Kanta has been mad about technology, since a very young age, when she received a Sinclair ZX81 and typed her first piece of code; it didn't work so she learnt the art of debugging with print statements very quickly. Kanta has since graduated with a PhD in Computer Science, developing an algorithm 'Selective Crossover' which improved the performance of Genetic Algorithms by up to 25%. She has a keen interest in machine learning algorithms.
She now has over 20 years of industry experience in end to end software development in multiple roles, ranging from Software Engineer to roles in Leadership across various disciplines. Most recently she has become involved in HPC at Linaro.
