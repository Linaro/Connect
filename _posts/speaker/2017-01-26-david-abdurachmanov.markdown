**Title: High Energy Physics and ARMv8 64-bit? Investigating The Future of Computing at CERN**
**Date: Wednesday, March 8**
**Time: 9.10 - 9.50**
Around the year 2000, the convergence on Linux and commodity x86_64 processors provided a homogeneous scientific computing platform which enabled the construction of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) for LHC data processing. This allowed the High Energy Physics (HEP) community to use a homogeneous software model utilizing the x86_64 architecture. LHC experiments at CERN, in particular ATLAS and CMS, started investigating ARMv8 64-bit (AArch64) architecture for HEP needs. A journey which started in 2013. The LHC community faces a great challenge regarding computing needs in 10 years and has started exploring public clouds, volunteer computing (e.g., LHC@home) and HPC facilities to increase peak computation capacity. This talk will contain information about future (a timeline of 10 years) computation needs for LHC experiments and the more recent progress done by ATLAS, CernVM and CMS teams on using ARMv8 64-bit/AArch64.



**Bio**

David is a Software Engineer at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (US) and part of DIANA/HEP project team. He is also part of Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where he works on software and computing R&D, incl. improving High Energy Physics (HEP) software performance, evaluating/porting/benchmarking new computing architectures and their platforms. Prior to that he was a Release Manger for CMS Software bundle (CMSSW) via Vilnius University (LT) and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (US). David is highly interested in alternative architectures for HEP workflows and has been involved in the enablement of ARMv7-A 32-bit (aarch32), ARMv8-A 64-bit (aarch64), PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64le & ppc64) architectures in experiment software and infrastructure. He feels enthusiastic about open-source software and collaboration with industry and open-source communities. Working on alternative architectures keeps him awake at night.
