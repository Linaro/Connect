**Title: Community 3.0**
**Date: Friday, September 30**
**Time: 8:55am – 9:35am**



The history of open source is littered with incredible communities: thousands of people connected around the world building new technology and innovating. We can do better though. We are a facing a new era of challenges and opportunities for collaboration at a global level. In this presentation from Jono Bacon, he will explain how we can build a new generation of communities that are more efficient and more productive than ever before.

The keynote will cover how community has evolved over the years, the structure of building powerful technical and open source communities, building workflow and on-ramps, building growth, and the balance between company and community relations. All of this will be wrapped up in his trademark loose and entertaining style.
