**Title: Big data, big challenges for ESA Space Science Missions' Archives**
**Date: Tuesday, March 7**
**Time: 8.30 - 9.15**



The European Space Agency's (ESA) current mission Gaia and upcoming one Euclid will generate massive amounts of astronomical data to be made freely available on-line through powerful data management systems. This big data era brings a change of paradigm and associated big challenges for building these missions' archives. The current use case of "bring the data to the user" is being replaced by the new concept of "bring the user to the data". This new generation of science archives is transforming into science exploitation and collaborative platforms, where the users can send her/his code to the data, run it on computing and storage services provided directly by the archive (where the data reside), and easily share all this with other scientists they're collaborating with.



**Biography**

Christophe Arviset is Head of the Data and Engineering Division at ESA’s European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Spain, close to Madrid. This includes responsibility of ESA’s space science missions in post-operations phase (ie Herschel, Planck and Rosetta), all technical IT services and other cross missions engineering activities to support Science Operations at ESAC. Furthermore, he’s heading the ESAC Science Data Centre, hosting science data archives of more than 20 ESA space science missions. He has been playing an active part of international data alliances (International Virtual Observatory Alliance and International Planetary Data Alliance) since their creation, and had been chairing the IVOA for the last two years. Initially Computer Science engineer by training, Christophe has developed more than 20 years of experience in science operations with special focus on science data management, data archives and long term data preservation.
