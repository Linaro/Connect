"Highlights OpenFastPath using OpenDataPlane to leverage SoC hardware acceleration capabilities for IPSEC offload

Using a traffic generator generate clear text traffic that is passed to a SoC with HW encryption support, forward the encrypted traffic to a second SoC for description and forward that to the traffic generation for confirmation of success.
