excerpt: "In preparation for move from LAVA v1 to LAVA v2 QA team started an effort
  towards Linaro Test Suites refactoring. The goal was to enable remote (automated)
  and local test execution of the same tests. As we crossed 50% mark of this task
  and used the assets in 16.12 ERP testing, we would like to present how it works.
  The session will show how to use Linaro Test Suites locally and in LAVA (v1 and
  v2 jobs). Local test execution will be a primary goal. We will demonstrate:\n\n
  \ - how to use test-runner script and \n\n  - how to compose or modify local test
  plan\n\n  - how to execute single test with and without test-runner\n\n  - how to
  view and interpret the results"
