excerpt: 'GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) are becoming a relevant
  functional block on SoCs, particularly on the Arm ecosystem. Extracting full performance
  of a GPU is now becoming a combination of well integrated and optimized software
  and hardware. Motivated by that, there are many Open GPU initiatives around the
  world using FPGAs, but most (if not all) of these are on Intel platforms. This project
  aims to present an Open GPU based on an FPGA using the Arm Instruction Set. The
  driver platform adopted was the well know MESA 3D (www.mesa3d.org). We will describe
  the co-design approach to designing the OpenGPU. A functional demonstration of the
  OpenGPU working on a range of OpenGl applications ported by Linaro will be shown.
  On the fly we will change drivers between: SW only, GPU on Asic, and OpenGPU to
  see its performance impact. The engineers that implemented this system will be at
  the session to support detailed technical questions.'
