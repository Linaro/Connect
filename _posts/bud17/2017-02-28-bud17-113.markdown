excerpt: "\"Delivering a well working distribution is hard. There are a lot of different
  hardware platforms that need to be verified and the software stack is in a big flux
  during development phases. In rolling releases, this gets even worse, as nothing
  ever stands still.\n \n The only sane answer to that problem are working Continuous
  Integration tests. The SUSE way to check whether any change breaks normal distribution
  behavior is OpenQA. Using OpenQA we can automatically run tests that hard working
  QA people did manually in the old days. That way we have fast enough turnaround
  times to find and reject breaking changes\n \n This session shows how OpenQA works,
  what pitfalls we had to make ARM work with OpenQA and what we're doing to improve
  it for ARM specific use cases.\""
