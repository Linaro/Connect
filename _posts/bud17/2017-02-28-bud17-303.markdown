excerpt: Sensory swarms of an IoT can be wirelessly interconnected to interact with
  the edge of a cloud, and offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act on a
  range of evolving physical quantities. The Swarm leverages the paradigm of independent,
  cross-niche and heterogeneous devices that can cooperate with each other in order
  to execute tasks synergistically. The Swarm architecture is device-oriented, focused
  on machine-to-machine communications. The Heterogeneous Broker is responsible for
  dynamically recruiting resources from the cloud; allowing information aggregation
  to make or aid decisions; and then to dynamically recruit actuation resources. In
  this talk we will describe our experience implementing and deploying the heterogeneous
  broker developed by USP in partnership with UC Berkeley. An special focus will be
  given to the 96Boards program.

★ Session Summary ★
Sensory swarms of an IoT can be wirelessly interconnected to interact with the edge of a cloud, and offer an unprecedented ability to monitor and act on a range of evolving physical quantities. The Swarm leverages the paradigm of independent, cross-niche and heterogeneous devices that can cooperate with each other in order to execute tasks synergistically. The Swarm architecture is device-oriented, focused on machine-to-machine communications. The Heterogeneous Broker is responsible for dynamically recruiting resources from the cloud; allowing information aggregation to make or aid decisions; and then to dynamically recruit actuation resources. In this talk we will describe our experience implementing and deploying the heterogeneous broker developed by USP in partnership with UC Berkeley. An special focus will be given to the 96Boards program.
