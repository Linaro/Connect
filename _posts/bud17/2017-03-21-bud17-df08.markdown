LHG has been working with upstreaming key components of the RDK over the last 3 years. This demo shows the RDK media framework (RMF) running on 96Boards platforms such as HiKey and DB410C.

● Reference Design Kit (RDK) Mediaclient using Yocto Krogoth/2.1 branch.

● Mediaclient functionality (streaming media playback) by integrating gstreamer V4L2 hardware video acceleration plugin.

● Westeros, an alternative lightweight & open source wayland compositor by using DRM support.

● Metrological’s WebKit for Wayland browser (web content rendering) by implementing offscreen egl target support for Westeros(Mesa backend only).

● 32bit RDK rootfs on 64bit Dragonboard 410c.
