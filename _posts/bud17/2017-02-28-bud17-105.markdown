excerpt: "Kernelci.org has been hailed as \u201Cthe most successful, public build
  and test system for Linux, in the world\". To keep that reputation, there is a need
  to do more testing faster, and we believe LAVA v2 will help us get there. Come learn
  about the effort underway to transition the testing system from LAVA v1 to LAVA
  v2, and the benefits that it will bring. \n \n In this session will we review the
  new architecture for distributed testing that LAVA v2 will enable. Also, providing
  status of what\u2019s working currently, and what is still in progress. Come be
  a part of the solution and help make the Linux kernel the best it can be!"

Kernelci.org has been hailed as “the most successful, public build and test system for Linux, in the world". To keep that reputation, there is a need to do more testing faster, and we believe LAVA v2 will help us get there. Come learn about the effort underway to transition the testing system from LAVA v1 to LAVA v2, and the benefits that it will bring. In this session will we review the new architecture for distributed testing that LAVA v2 will enable. Also, providing status of what’s working currently, and what is still in progress.
