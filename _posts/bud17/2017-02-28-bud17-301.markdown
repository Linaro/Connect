excerpt: Nested virtualization, the ability to run a virtual machine inside another
  virtual machine, is increasingly important because of the need to deploy virtual
  machines running software stacks on top of virtualized cloud infrastructure, as
  well as for prototyping and testing. As Arm servers make inroads in various deployment
  scenarios, being able to support nested virtualization on Arm is a key requirement,
  which has been met recently with the introduction of nested virtualization support
  in the latest Armv8.3 revision of the architecture. I will present the initial effort
  to introduce Arm nested virtualization support to KVM/Arm, which involves adding
  significant logic to core KVM/Arm code, MMU support, timers, and the GIC emulation.
  I will also briefly discuss a paravirtualization approach we have used to prototype
  and evaluate the implementation on current Armv8 hardware without hardware support
  for nested virtualization.
