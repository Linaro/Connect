excerpt: Virtual Open Sytems has demonstrated OPNFV Colorado integration of its Lua-based
  VOSYSwitch data plane, deployed within an x86 environment. With the port of LuaJIT
  to AArch64, the solution is migrated to the OPNFV/ArmBand release. The presentation
  will show experimental results, discuss the specifics of the migration and issues
  that we conquered during the process. At the end, the next steps and the future
  plans will be outlined.
