excerpt: Representing the historical progress of work represented in JIRA has been
  problematic due to the way history is stored in JIRA cards. The objective of this
  initiative was to automate the collection of data from JIRA to build history and
  expedite generating reports on engineering status. This presentation will show the
  automation with javascript embedded in a Google spreadsheet. An added benefit to
  the automation is the ease of which it will build a history of status for ongoing
  analysis.
