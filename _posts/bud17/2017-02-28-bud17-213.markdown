excerpt: This technical discussion will highlight on-going Red Hat activities for
  the integration of an Enterprise Virtualization stack and present a vision of an
  enterprise guest.   The status of features such as live migration, device assignment,
  H52PCIe topology, large guest support, and more will be presented. The status will
  cover the integration up to the libvirt level of the stack, and exhibit that components
  above libvirt can ""just work"", even when development, to this time, has been predominately
  focused on other architectures. As feature parity with x86 is a goal, the remaining
  gaps with x86 wil also be highlighted. Finally, the status of the verification efforts,
  specifically those involving the Avocado and kvm-unit-tests frameworks, will be
  presented.

★ Session Summary ★
This technical discussion will highlight on-going Red Hat activities for the integration of an Enterprise Virtualization stack and present a vision of an enterprise guest. The status of features such as live migration, device assignment, H52PCIe topology, large guest support, and more will be presented. The status will cover the integration up to the libvirt level of the stack, and exhibit that components above libvirt can """"just work"""", even when development, to this time, has been predominately focused on other architectures. As feature parity with x86 is a goal, the remaining gaps with x86 wil also be highlighted. Finally, the status of the verification efforts, specifically those involving the Avocado and kvm-unit-tests frameworks, will be presented.
