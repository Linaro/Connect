excerpt: "The fifth generation mobile communications network (5G) is not your \u201Ctraditional
  telecom network\u201D but optimized for connected and intelligent machines, having
  distributed cloud capacity and supporting devices ranging from gigabits per second
  to multi-year battery life. Software, connectivity and digitalization are reshaping
  both industries and society at an ever increasing rate and 5G is a strong catalyst.
  This keynote will explore this development, including how products and services
  are revolutionized and how many of today\u2019s value chains are being overthrown."
