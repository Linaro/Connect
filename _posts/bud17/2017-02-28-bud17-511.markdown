excerpt: "The University of Sao Paulo, with support of LSITEC (an NGO Design House),
  has all of the necessary equipment to design and manufacture 96boards computers
  and mezzanine boards. Working with one of Linaro\u2019s partners, LeMaker, LSITEC
  has produced the LeMaker Guitar single board computer under license, and is now
  looking forward to producing 96boards and accessories the same way. The final goal
  is to strengthen the gap between industry and universities, producing professionals
  with high design skills in embedding computing to society, while providing to Linaro
  and its partners the ability to have high quality boards in various volumes of manufacturing."
