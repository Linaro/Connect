excerpt: "The European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) current mission Gaia and upcoming
  one Euclid will generate massive amounts of astronomical data to be made freely
  available on-line through powerful data management systems. This big data era brings
  a change of paradigm and associated big challenges for building these missions\u2019
  archives. The current use case of \u201Cbring the data to the user\u201D is being
  replaced by the new concept of \u201Cbring the user to the data\u201D. This new
  generation of science archives is transforming into science exploitation and collaborative
  platforms, where the users can send her/his code to the data, run it on computing
  and storage services provided directly by the archive (where the data reside), and
  easily share all this with other scientists they\u2019re collaborating with."

Session ID: BUD17-200K1
Session Name: Big data, big challenges for ESA Space Science Missions’ Archives - BUD17-200K1
Speaker: Christophe Arviset
Track: Keynote


★ Session Summary ★
The European Space Agency’s (ESA) current mission Gaia and upcoming one Euclid will generate massive amounts of astronomical data to be made freely available on-line through powerful data management systems. This big data era brings a change of paradigm and associated big challenges for building these missions’ archives. The current use case of “bring the data to the user” is being replaced by the new concept of “bring the user to the data”. This new generation of science archives is transforming into science exploitation and collaborative platforms, where the users can send her/his code to the data, run it on computing and storage services provided directly by the archive (where the data reside), and easily share all this with other scientists they’re collaborating with.
