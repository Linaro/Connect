excerpt: "Contiguous page hint is a feature in AArch32 and AArch64 which could decrease
  the number of TLB misses and improve the performance by sharing a single TLB entry
  across 16 4k pages whenever the pages are also physically contiguous. Currently,
  it is only used in hugetlb which limited the scenarios where it can be used. This
  session will share and discuss following things:\n 1. The current design of hugepage,
  transparent hugepage and page\n  Fault and proposal from Bamvor\n \n 2. Compare
  and analyze the performance of different designs, including\n  transparent hugepage,
  hugepage and Bamvor' design.\n \n 3. Discuss the scenarios which are suitable for
  this work beyond the\n  enterprise."

★ Session Summary ★
Contiguous page hint is a feature in AArch32 and AArch64 which could decrease the number of TLB misses and improve the performance by sharing a single TLB entry across 16 4k pages whenever the pages are also physically contiguous. Currently, it is only used in hugetlb which limited the scenarios where it can be used. This session will share and discuss following things:
 1. The current design of hugepage, transparent hugepage and page
  Fault and proposal from Bamvor

 2. Compare and analyze the performance of different designs, including
  transparent hugepage, hugepage and Bamvor' design.

 3. Discuss the scenarios which are suitable for this work beyond the
  enterprise.
