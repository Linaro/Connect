excerpt: Device Tree is well established in the Linux kernel. But since there could
  be other bootloader(s) and firmware components involved that needs to configure
  the hardware and thereby also needs to update the Device Tree blobs before passing
  it to Linux kernel. Therefore we are looking for a well established way for firmware
  to also make use and modify the Device Tree blobs before handing them over to Linux
  kernel. With this BoF session we would like to get started a gather ideas etc.
