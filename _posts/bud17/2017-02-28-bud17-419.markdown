excerpt: The timekeeping code in the Linux kernel is used by nearly everything from
  the low power idle paths to device drivers. In this presentation, Stephen Boyd will
  take the audience on a tour of the timekeeping code, exploring how the kernel abstracts
  the hardware, how those abstractions are built upon to implement NOHZ, timers, hrtimers,
  cpu-idle, POSIX clocks, etc. and how we keep things working when these abstractions
  break down with the tick-broadcast mechanism.
