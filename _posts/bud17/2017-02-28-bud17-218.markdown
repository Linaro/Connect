excerpt: "The Per Entity Load Tracking (PELT) is a key stone in tasks placement of
  the scheduler but suffers of some weakness when it\u2019s not just bugs. During
  the last LPC, it has been decided to fix all pending issues of PELT before starting
  to consider another load tracking mechanism for scheduler and/or EAS. This session
  will show the improvement reached since the last connect and the LPC as well as
  the next ones. We will also looks at the RT class which lacks a good load tracking."

★ Session Summary ★
The Per Entity Load Tracking (PELT) is a key stone in tasks placement of the scheduler but suffers of some weakness when it’s not just bugs. During the last LPC, it has been decided to fix all pending issues of PELT before starting to consider another load tracking mechanism for scheduler and/or EAS. This session will show the improvement reached since the last connect and the LPC as well as the next ones. We will also looks at the RT class which lacks a good load tracking.
