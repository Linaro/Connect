  including on-line banking, payments, e-government access, and enterprise login.  A
  TEE (possibly aided by a local security processor) is a core component of the envisioned

  policy for "their" keys, the system supports key ACLs which through an OS/TEE layer
  governs which applications a key may be used with.   A consequence of this arrangement
  is that cryptographic keys become first-class OS objects like files.  The protocol
