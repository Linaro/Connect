excerpt: The SKS/KeyGen2 project is about establishing an security architecture, provisioning
  and management scheme for cryptographic keys targeting a wide variety of applications
  including on-line banking, payments, e-government access, and enterprise login.  A
  TEE (possibly aided by a local security processor) is a core component of the envisioned
  architecture.  In order to enable easy enrollment, a browser-based provisioning
  protocol is another core component.  Since a cryptographic key (unlike a file),
  usually represents a relationship to a remote party which also typically imply a
  policy for "their" keys, the system supports key ACLs which through an OS/TEE layer
  governs which applications a key may be used with.   A consequence of this arrangement
  is that cryptographic keys become first-class OS objects like files.  The protocol
  and basic key store is already running as an application which is used for testing
  and evaluation. What's missing is the OS/TEE/Browser integration, something which
