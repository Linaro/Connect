excerpt: We have recently achieved a critical milestone of having core enablement
  for SBSA (Server Base System Architecture) and SBBR (Server Base Boot Requirements)
  in upstream kernels "out of the box". These initial standards address minimal functionality
  and will soon undergo additional development as we seek to cover more complex use
  case requirements, such as NFV, and those introduced by the emergence of workload
  acceleration (CCIX, FPGAs, etc.). In this session, we will gather feedback and input
  on where to go next.

We have recently achieved a critical milestone of having core enablement for SBSA (Server Base System Architecture) and SBBR (Server Base Boot Requirements) in upstream kernels "out of the box". These initial standards address minimal functionality and will soon undergo additional development as we seek to cover more complex use case requirements, such as NFV, and those introduced by the emergence of workload acceleration (CCIX, FPGAs, etc.).
