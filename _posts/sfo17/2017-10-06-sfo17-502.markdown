excerpt: Writing test cases for virtualization is always a daunting task because there
  are numerous possible combinations (e.g. guest OS types, emulated devices) in virtualization
  configuration. This talk presents an auto testing framework, Avocado, which provides
  a powerful yet flexible framework to users who are writing test cases on AArch64.
  We demonstrate how to write and debug test cases with real-world examples. This
  talk also covers our experience of integrating Avocado with Jenkins CI tools on
  Red Hat's internal testing infrastructure.
