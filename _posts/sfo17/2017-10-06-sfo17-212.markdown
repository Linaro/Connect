excerpt: The automotive industry has fallen behind the smartphone in terms of features
  and functionality because innovation is too slow, time-to-market is too long and
  there's very little software reuse. Automotive companies like Toyota are now in
  the software business, and they are realizing that open source and sharing a common
  platform is the way forward. Automotive Grade Linux recently announced that their
  platform will debut in the 2018 US Toyota Camry. General Manager of Automotive,
  Dan Cauchy will discuss this transformation and provide insight into why automakers
  like Toyota are adopting AGL.
