excerpt: "The current trend of IoT market segment is expected to enable and deploy
  about 50 billion connected devices by year 2020. IoT devices will be deployed across
  the board to cater to multiple use cases like Home/building Automation, Automotive,
  a highly fragmented embedded segment: gateways, set top boxes, security cameras,
  industrial automation, digital signage, healthcare, etc. This trend will bring about
  a great challenge of securing the connected end point IoT devices from a myriad
  of physical and remote attacks ex: DDOS Mirai botnet launched through IoT devices
  like digital cameras and DVR players \n \n Problem Statement: Each use cases has
  its own IoT device constraints like: Cost, Power, Performance, memory footprint,
  security objectives, etc. The fundamental basis for any secure IoT and Embedded
  solution is the Root of Trust (RoT), which provides assurance of the integrity of
  the system software from: boot and runtime firmware, to OS loader, to the Kernel,
  to the user Applications. This poses a serious issue and challenges the one-size
  fits all RoT solution model.\n \n Arm has taken on this challenge head on to come
  up with a microcontroller security architecture solution that caters to the various
  IoT devices constraints, by offering Arm Cortex-M family of processors. Arm’s flexible
  and scalable architecture solution will allow an OEM or Silicon partner to adapt
  the base security architecture and to extend it in a seamless way. This caters to
  the requirements of different market segments through add-on hardware, firmware
  and software security enhancements. \n \n The session will present the Arm’s base
  security system and software architecture based on the upcoming Cortex V8M solution
  that will provide a hardware and firmware assisted Trust Zone based Security RoT
  aka TBSA-M for a range of markets, to include the highly constrained IoT devices.
  Furthermore, the session will discuss about how the base RoT capability can be extended
  in a seamless way with additional hardware assisted mechanisms to offer high levels
  of functionality and/or robustness for less constrained IoT devises with options
  like TBSA-M+, TBSA-HSM and platform level security software abstraction framework
  to decouple the chosen RoT capability for various OSes and the Cloud security frameworks."

★ Session Summary ★
The current trend of IoT market segment is expected to enable and deploy about 50 billion connected devices by year 2020. IoT devices will be deployed across the board to cater to multiple use cases like Home/building Automation, Automotive, a highly fragmented embedded segment: gateways, set top boxes, security cameras, industrial automation, digital signage, healthcare, etc. This trend will bring about a great challenge of securing the connected end point IoT devices from a myriad of physical and remote attacks ex: DDOS Mirai botnet launched through IoT devices like digital cameras and DVR players

Problem Statement: Each use cases has its own IoT device constraints like: Cost, Power, Performance, memory footprint, security objectives, etc. The fundamental basis for any secure IoT and Embedded solution is the Root of Trust (RoT), which provides assurance of the integrity of the system software from: boot and runtime firmware, to OS loader, to the Kernel, to the user Applications.
