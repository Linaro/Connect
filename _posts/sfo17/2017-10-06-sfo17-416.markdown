excerpt: 'The uptake of Linux in modern cars is on the rise. It is very hard to make

  Linux safe enough for safety assessors. Thus far the industry has used a

  proprietary layer of safety certifiable system software that in addition to

  running mission critical applications also allows running Linux safely in

  virtual machines. Can that layer be open source as well ? Without compromising

  on safety and security certifiability ? This session presents L4Re - an open

  source project that ticks a lot of boxes in order to let Linux be what it''s

  good at while providing the safety that the Auto world demands.'

★ Session Summary ★
The uptake of Linux in modern cars is on the rise. It is very hard to make
Linux safe enough for safety assessors. Thus far the industry has used a
proprietary layer of safety certifiable system software that in addition to
running mission critical applications also allows running Linux safely in
virtual machines. Can that layer be open source as well ? Without compromising
on safety and security certifiability ? This session presents L4Re - an open
source project that ticks a lot of boxes in order to let Linux be what it's
good at while providing the safety that the Auto world demands.
