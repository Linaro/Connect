excerpt: "Now that large community open source projects like Linux power the world\u2019s
  technology, enforcement of open source licenses like GPL has become a serious policy
  issue for the technology community of the world.  As enforcement has matured in
  the last decade, multiple players have stepped forward to spearhead enforcement
  -- including community enforcers, strategic enforcers, and copyright profiteers.

  struggling to balance the interests of authors and the interests of users. Ms. Meeker
  will outline the issues faced by our community, and what is being done to address
  them.   \n \nThis talk will explain the effect of open source\u2019s direct licensing
  model on enforcement, explain which enforcement players are vying for the hearts
  and minds of developers, and pose potential solutions to discourage disruptive enforcement
  efforts.  To sue or not to sue -- that is the question."

★ Session Summary ★
Now that large community open source projects like Linux power the world’s technology, enforcement of open source licenses like GPL has become a serious policy issue for the technology community of the world.  As enforcement has matured in the last decade, multiple players have stepped forward to spearhead enforcement -- including community enforcers, strategic enforcers, and copyright profiteers.  As we move into a new generation of software engineering, community projects are struggling to balance the interests of authors and the interests of users. Ms. Meeker will outline the issues faced by our community, and what is being done to address them.   
 
This talk will explain the effect of open source’s direct licensing model on enforcement, explain which enforcement players are vying for the hearts and minds of developers, and pose potential solutions to discourage disruptive enforcement efforts.  To sue or not to sue -- that is the question.
