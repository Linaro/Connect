excerpt: Some platforms have the capability to configure the performance state of
  their power domains. The process of configuring the performance state is pretty
  much platform dependent and we may need to work with a wide range of configurables.  For
  some platforms, like Qualcomm, it can be a positive integer value alone, while in
  other cases it can be voltage levels, etc.
