excerpt: The cloud is changing how modern applications are being developed, deployed
  and consumed. Cloud services are transitioning to container-based, modular microservices
  and even functions. Developers expect more frequent release cycles and a more flexible
  distribution model. Java continues to be one of the most popular language and runtime
  in the world. The release cycle and distribution model for Java SE is well over
  a decade old, and need to be refreshed to support the changing requirements driven
  by the Cloud. This session will discuss the recently announced changes to the Java
  release cycle and distribution model. It will also cover the new Java 9 release
  and discuss the Java roadmap beyond 9.
