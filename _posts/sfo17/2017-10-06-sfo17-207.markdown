excerpt: "Real Time kernel is out of linux kernel upstream for long time. It keep
  contributing much of key features into upstream, like high resolution timer, lockdep,
  thread irq, PI, ftrace, etc. The Linux foundation setup a group to merge it all
  into upstream.\n \n This session is going to review RT requirements, the block issue
  in upstream kernel, and the solution to fix them in RT. We also go through the current
  out of upstream RT code. Introduce the base stone of RT features: sleeping spin_lock.
  This session also covers the basic criteria of RT, the general testing tools."

★ Session Summary ★
Real Time kernel is out of linux kernel upstream for long time. It keep contributing much of key features into upstream, like high resolution timer, lockdep, thread irq, PI, ftrace, etc. The Linux foundation setup a group to merge it all into upstream.

This session is going to review RT requirements, the block issue in upstream kernel, and the solution to fix them in RT. We also go through the current out of upstream RT code. Introduce the base stone of RT features: sleeping spin_lock. This session also covers the basic criteria of RT, the general testing tools.
