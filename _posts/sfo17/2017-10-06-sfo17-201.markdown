excerpt: "Building a totally secure boot system goes through establishing a full trust
  relationship among all the different involved software layers, to prevent execution
  of unauthorized software. Doing that by implementing a complete Chain Of Trust based
  on existing industry standards and open source software guarantees interoperability,
  stability and easy maintainability.\n This presentation will describe how this goal
  can be achieved on Arm systems from the very first firmware executed at power-on
  up to the Operating System execution by combining Arm Trusted Firmware with EDK2,
  two reference open-source implementations of the Arm Trusted Board Boot Requirement
  and UEFI Secure Boot specifications respectively."

Session Name: Secure Boot on Arm systems – Building a complete Chain of Trust upon existing industry standards using open-source firmware - SFO17-201
Speaker: Matteo Carlini 
Track: Security


★ Session Summary ★
Building a totally secure boot system goes through establishing a full trust relationship among all the different involved software layers, to prevent execution of unauthorized software. Doing that by implementing a complete Chain Of Trust based on existing industry standards and open source software guarantees interoperability, stability and easy maintainability.
 This presentation will describe how this goal can be achieved on Arm systems from the very first firmware executed at power-on up to the Operating System execution by combining Arm Trusted Firmware with EDK2, two reference open-source implementations of the Arm Trusted Board Boot Requirement and UEFI Secure Boot specifications respectively.
