excerpt: Nested virtualization is increasingly important because of the need to deploy
  virtual machines running software stacks on top of virtualized cloud infrastructure,
  as well as for prototyping and testing. Arm recently introduced nested virtualization
  support in the latest Armv8.3 revision of the architecture. We will present the
  efforts and challenges to introduce Arm nested virtualization support to KVM/Arm,
  which involves adding significant logic to core KVM/Arm code, MMU support, timers,
  and the GIC emulation including the changes we made since the last Linaro Connect.
  We will also discuss a paravirtualization approach we have used to prototype and
  evaluate the implementation on current Armv8 hardware without hardware support for
  nested virtualization. We will present performance results and discuss future techniques
  to improve performance.

Nested virtualization is increasingly important because of the need to deploy virtual machines running software stacks on top of virtualized cloud infrastructure, as well as for prototyping and testing. Arm recently introduced nested virtualization support in the latest Armv8.3 revision of the architecture. We will present the efforts and challenges to introduce Arm nested virtualization support to KVM/Arm, which involves adding significant logic to core KVM/Arm code, MMU support, timers, and the GIC emulation including the changes we made since the last Linaro Connect. We will also discuss a paravirtualization approach we have used to prototype and evaluate the implementation on current Armv8 hardware without hardware support for nested virtualization. We will present performance results and discuss future techniques to improve performance.
