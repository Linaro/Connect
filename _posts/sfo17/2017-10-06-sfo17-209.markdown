excerpt: Realtime applications have traditionally used interrupt latency as the performance
  metric. Many industrial , automotive and audio/video applications require deterministic
  performance from networking. Fixed latency can often be dealt with but jitter is
  especially problematic. New Ethernet features such as time sensitive networking
  (TSN) ensure single digit microsecond level jitter in a LAN. The networking driver
  and stack jitter measurements are presented and analyzed.

Realtime applications have traditionally used interrupt latency as the performance metric. Many industrial , automotive and audio/video applications require deterministic performance from networking. Fixed latency can often be dealt with but jitter is especially problematic. New Ethernet features such as time sensitive networking (TSN) ensure single digit microsecond level jitter in a LAN.
