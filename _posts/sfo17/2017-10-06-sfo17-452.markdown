excerpt: Ceph block I/O performance is the basis for achieving database and virtual
  machine performance for business-critical applications. In order to achieve a balance
  of storage I/O performance with infrastructure costs for Ceph clusters, solid state
  storage with Arm processors can be deployed an optimal cost justification on a $/GB
  basis. This presentation provides an overview of storage performance benchmarks
  to help formulate a scalable Ceph cluster environment for performance-oriented deployments.
