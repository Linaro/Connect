excerpt: Several open source test frameworks for Linux exist and are being actively
  adopted and used.  This includes KernelCI, LAVA, Fuego, Avacado, kerneltest and
  others.  In this session, Tim would like to discuss the state of these different
  test systems, and propose standards in some areas so that the different frameworks
  can share infrastructure and interoperate.  This include standards for results formats,
  interfaces to commonly-used utility programs, and for board control hardware.
