excerpt: Userspace software is imperfect and everyone knows it but most of people
  are afraid to talk openly about this. Usually problems start when people try to
  run this software for a long period of time. This problem already gave server guys
  a lot of sleepless nights. Nowadays also IoT and embedded Linux world is facing
  very the same problem. Unfortunately solutions known from server world usually cannot
  be directly applied here due to relatively high overhead. During this talk Krzysztof
  will discuss problems related to monitoring embedded Linux distribution. Firstly,
  available Kernel infrastructure for efficient resource usage monitoring will be
  presented. Then Krzysztof will try to identify what's missing and show how we could
  fill this gap using rlimit-events concept. Last part is going to be a discussion
  on a presented idea and experience sharing.
