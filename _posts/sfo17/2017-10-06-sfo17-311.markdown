excerpt: For many years, companies have known they need to provide license compliance
  artifacts (source, annotations, etc.) when they use open source. However the true
  source of what license apply to which pieces of code resides in the open source
  projects, and after the fact discovery by companies is time consuming, error prone,
  and expensive. As a result, license compliance is not always what it should be,
  and the problem keeps getting worse, and people want to ignore it - and make it
  someone else's problem. Kind of like the tailors and the Emperor's new clothes.
  With recent advances in open source projects, like FOSSology, ScanCode and others,
  integrating scanning for detecting compliance information in CI build loops is now
  possible, making the ability to be used by the projects, where bugs can be easily
  fixed. In this talk, Kate will go through some of the current technologies available
  to help with this problem.
