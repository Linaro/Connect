excerpt: "ION has undergone a lot of change upstream in its bid to be de-staged. We’d
  give a brief update on what’s changed, the proposed libion changes, and then we’d
  like to discuss:\n - [Actionable] feedback from members about what additional features
  does the upstream ION need to still support\n - How can we encourage them to submit
  changes\n - Any other ideas around ION in mainline."
