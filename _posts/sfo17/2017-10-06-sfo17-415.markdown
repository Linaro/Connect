excerpt: "Updating remotely an IoT device condenses solid knowledge of server-side
  applications, DevOps and expertise with different embedded operating systems: it
  requires knowledge of a full IoT pipeline from embedded devices to back end applications.\n
  This session is a hands-on journey on the entire remote update pipeline. The session
  will cover an embedded OS updates, JVMs and single applications updates, managed
  by an open source web tool, Eclipse Hawkbit.\n The Eclipse Hawkbit project includes
  functionality for triggering groups of devices to perform an update, accompanied
  by an image repository and basic reporting and monitoring capabilities.\n In particular:
  uploading an artifact to the repository, assigning it to eligible devices, managing
  the roll out campaign for a large number of devices, monitoring and reporting the
  progress of the roll-out and requirements regarding security and reliability are
  essential features of the process and the IoT Platform.\n On the device side, the
  update process is managed by SWUpdate, a Linux Update agent used to provide an efficient
  and safe way to update an embedded system. The session will explore the single image
  mode update developed by Kynetics as a robust and efficient strategy to update safely
  embedded devices integrated with Eclipse Hawkbit"

★ Session Summary ★
Updating remotely an IoT device condenses solid knowledge of server-side applications, DevOps and expertise with different embedded operating systems: it requires knowledge of a full IoT pipeline from embedded devices to back end applications.
This session is a hands-on journey on the entire remote update pipeline. The session will cover an embedded OS updates, JVMs and single applications updates, managed by an open source web tool, Eclipse Hawkbit.
The Eclipse Hawkbit project includes functionality for triggering groups of devices to perform an update, accompanied by an image repository and basic reporting and monitoring capabilities.
In particular: uploading an artifact to the repository, assigning it to eligible devices, managing the roll out campaign for a large number of devices, monitoring and reporting the progress of the roll-out and requirements regarding security and reliability are essential features of the process and the IoT Platform.
On the device side, the update process is managed by SWUpdate, a Linux Update agent used to provide an efficient and safe way to update an embedded system. The session will explore the single image mode update developed by Kynetics as a robust and efficient strategy to update safely embedded devices integrated with Eclipse Hawkbit
