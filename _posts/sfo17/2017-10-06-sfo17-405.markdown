excerpt: This presentation describes the evolution of a multi-producer / multi-consumer
  ring buffer from a lock-based beginning to a scalable non-blocking design. Hardware
  and software properties that limit scalability and prevent non-blocking behavior
  is identified. A novel use of lock-free delegation to release ring buffer updates
  is presented.
