excerpt: 'All are welcome!


  At the first edition of the Automotive BoF held at Budapest David Rusling and

  Robin Randhawa broached the topic of open source software use in the safety

  critical parts of the Automotive domain. That discussion led to some important

  realisations about Linux possibilities and realities. In this second edition

  of the Automotive Bof David and Robin provide further interesting insights

  from discussions with major Tier 1 Automotive OEMs. Overall, things seem to be

  trending towards some concrete proposals for the role of Linaro in this space.
