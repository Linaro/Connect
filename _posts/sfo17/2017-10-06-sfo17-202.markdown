Track: Power Management


★ Session Summary ★
The ACPI PM domain supports the so called direct_complete path during system sleep in a way to avoid wasting power, but also to decrease the system suspend/resume time.

However, the direct_complete path has limitations and doesn’t perform well in all scenarios. The so called, runtime PM centric path, often offers a better option.

This session compares the two concepts and gives an update on the related work for ACPI PM domain.
