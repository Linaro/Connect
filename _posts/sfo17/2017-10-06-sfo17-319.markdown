excerpt: "The Arm\u2019s System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is a set of
  operating system-independent software interfaces that are used in system management
  to abstract power and other system management tasks from the APs. Consequent to
  the publication of this Platform Design Document (PDD), a suitable test suite is
  developed and made available for adopters to assure compliance of their implementation
  against this specification. In this session we provide an outline of the design
  considerations taken into account while developing this test suite and also explain
  the porting guidelines for any potential users of this test suite. Here we also
  demonstrate the execution of this test suite run on Juno Arm Development Platform
  (ADP) using LAVA."

★ Session Summary ★
The Arm’s System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is a set of operating system-independent software interfaces that are used in system management to abstract power and other system management tasks from the APs. Consequent to the publication of this Platform Design Document (PDD), a suitable test suite is developed and made available for adopters to assure compliance of their implementation against this specification. In this session we provide an outline of the design considerations taken into account while developing this test suite and also explain the porting guidelines for any potential users of this test suite. Here we also demonstrate the execution of this test suite run on Juno Arm Development Platform (ADP) using LAVA.
