excerpt: One of the key features of QEMU is the ability to emulate foreign computer
  architectures. This means, for example, that you can run your favorite ARM binaries
  and system images on your x86 laptop or server. QEMU is used a key tool for engineers
  and test infrastructure across both ARM and x86 ecosystems, and is also the basis
  of the Android emulator. QEMU’s emulation features is also used for system modeling
  in some scenarios. In this session we will present what QEMU currently does well
  as an emulator, and what the QEMU project has deliberately deemed as out-of-scope.
  We will also discuss future avenues that could be pursued to further improve capabilities
  of QEMU emulation, such as adding support for new architecture features, and support
  writing device emulation in a higher level language than C. We encourage the audience
  to provide user stories of QEMU from Linaro member companies to help direct our
  efforts.
