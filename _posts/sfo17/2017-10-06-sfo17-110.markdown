excerpt: This session is going to focus on getting started as an LLVM developer. LLVM
  is rather large and, although it has a lot of documentation, it may feel a bit daunting
  to navigate at first. We'll go over some of the essential things that you need to
  know when starting to work upstream - what tools you're likely to end up using in
  your day-to-day life, how to write tests for your code and how to interact with
  the community.
