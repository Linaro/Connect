excerpt: The Internet of Things (IoT) consists in the integration of networked computing
  entities into objects of our everyday life. Billions of devices are expected to
  be connected in the next years, revolutionizing modern society. An emerging approach
  that demands the support of dynamic and flexible management in the IoT is the Swarm.
  It envisions that a great number of independent, cross-niche and heterogeneous devices
  can autonomously cooperate with each other in order to execute tasks with synergy.
  It is aligned with the trend of social computing, where computing devices share
  their resources with each other, but in the Swarm, the idea is to have it happening
  autonomously, generating an almost organic computing network. In addition, it should
  not be limited to niches, working as a truly open system. In order to enable the
  Swarm, a software module, named Swarm Broker is integrated into each device that
  participate in the Swarm. This talk will present our approach for the Swarm Broker
  implementation and its status. The advances in the integration of constrained devices
  into the Swarm and the semantic engine architecture will be presented.
