excerpt: "Cover an outline of the AOSP Devboard effort with HiKey and now HiKey960,
  work on upstreaming, generic HAL implementations for Linux common hardware interfaces,
  graphics efforts, along with issues coming from the transition to Treble, and from
  upstream kernel work colliding with legacy Android kernel interfaces.\n \n This
  presentation will be similar to one given earlier at Linux Plumbers but will go
  a bit deeper on issues and will provide some context to the discussion had at Linux
  Plumbers."
