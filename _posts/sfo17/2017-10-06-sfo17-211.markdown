excerpt: The reference UEFI implementation, EDK2, has historically not contained much
  in the way of actual platform support, and has not had any process for dealing with
  it. For the past few years, I've instead been running a separate repository called
  OpenPlatformPkg, containing platform source code. Last year, the process for how
  to get platform code adopted into TianoCore was imlpemented, and the code in OpenPlatform
  has (hopefully) now been integrated into the official edk2-platforms repository.
  This talk gives a summary about the changes in process, code structure and tooling.

★ Session Summary ★
The reference UEFI implementation, EDK2, has historically not contained much in the way of actual platform support, and has not had any process for dealing with it. For the past few years, I've instead been running a separate repository called OpenPlatformPkg, containing platform source code. Last year, the process for how to get platform code adopted into TianoCore was imlpemented, and the code in OpenPlatform has (hopefully) now been integrated into the official edk2-platforms repository. This talk gives a summary about the changes in process, code structure and tooling.
