excerpt: 'Some platforms have the capability to configure the performance state of
  their power domains. The process of configuring the performance state is pretty
  much platform dependent and we may need to work with a wide range of configurables.  For
  some platforms, like Qualcomm, it can be a positive integer value alone, while in
  other cases it can be voltage levels, etc.


  The power-domain framework until now was only designed for the idle state management
  of the device and this needs to change in order to reuse the power-domain framework
  for active state management of the devices.'

★ Session Summary ★
Some platforms have the capability to configure the performance state of their power domains. The process of configuring the performance state is pretty much platform dependent and we may need to work with a wide range of configurables.  For some platforms, like Qualcomm, it can be a positive integer value alone, while in other cases it can be voltage levels, etc.

The power-domain framework until now was only designed for the idle state management of the device and this needs to change in order to reuse the power-domain framework for active state management of the devices.
