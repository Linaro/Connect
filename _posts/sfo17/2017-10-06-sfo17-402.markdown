Session Name: SDIO power on/off time impacts system suspend/resume time! - SFO17-402
Speaker: Ulf Hansson

Track: Power Management

★ Session Summary ★
Often an embedded WLAN chip is connected via an SDIO bus. During a system suspend/resume the SDIO card (WLAN chip) gets re-initialized unconditionally, even when it’s not needed.

The re-initialization of an SDIO card often consumes several hundreds of milliseconds, as also shown by real measurements. Unfortunate this time adds up to the total suspend/resume time for the system.

In this session the problem is being described and a solution being explored.
