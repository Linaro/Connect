excerpt: Server chips based on the ARM v8A architecture deliver greater core density
  and lower power consumption for your datacenter. Azul’s Zulu build of OpenJDK is
  a widely-deployed open source Java platform that is freely available, fully conformant
  to the Java SE specification, and supports the ARM v8 architecture. In this presentation
  we’ll look at how using Zulu makes moving enterprise Java applications to the ARM-enabled
  data center easy and cost efficient while delivering excellent performance.
