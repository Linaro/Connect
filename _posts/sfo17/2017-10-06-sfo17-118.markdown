★ Session Summary ★
Last Connect, we introduced mcuboot, the IoT bootloader used by Zephyr and mynewt. Now that we’ve had a release, this session gives an update on the project, what’s been done, and what is coming.

The open source MCUBoot project hosted by Runtime to provide an operating system-agnostic secure boot loader for 32-bit microcontrollers has been ported to multiple operating systems, specifically, the Apache Mynewt OS, the Zephyr OS, and the Riot OS. An overview of the features in the first successful release of MCUBoot project will be presented along with the use cases that drive the requirements for them. The talk will touch on the utilities included in the project such as a tool to sign images, a simulator for testing and regression etc. It will discuss why MCUBoot, with its memory footprint, performance, security considerations, product-driven goals, and ease of porting, is a compelling choice for an OS on constrained IoT devices. Finally, the near and long-term feature roadmaps for the project will be presented.
