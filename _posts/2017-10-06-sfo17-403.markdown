excerpt: A key drawback in the use of full system virtualization is the performance
  penalty introduced by hypervisors. This problem is especially present on ARM, which
  has significantly higher overhead for some workloads compared to x86, due to differences
  in the hardware virtualization support. The key reason for the overhead on ARM is
  the need to multiplex kernel mode state between the hypervisor and VMs, which each
  run their own kernel. This talk will cover how we have redesigned and optimized
  KVM/ARM, resulting in an order of magnitude reduction in overhead, and resulted
  in less overhead than x86 on key hypervisor operations. Our optimizations rely on
  new hardware support in ARMv8.1, the Virtualization Host Extensions (VHE), but also
  support legacy hardware through invasive modifications to Linux to support running
  the kernel in the hypervisor-specific CPU mode, EL2
