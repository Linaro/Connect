description: "Kernel debugging involves learning a wide variety of tools whose scope is very different to a traditional stop-the-world debugger. By focusing on use cases rather than on the detail of exactly how each tool works we are able to cover a wide variety of advanced debug tools in a short space of time. This provides both a foundation and a real-world context for detailed examination of different debug tools."
