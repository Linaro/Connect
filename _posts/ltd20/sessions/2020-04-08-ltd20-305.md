  is becoming one of the key technologies to improve the safety and reduce development
  costs on the automotive space as it allows for mixed criticality workloads and the
  consolidation of ECUs under a common system.<br>We will present the Automotive reference
  stack, a collection of Yocto layers to build a platform suitable for safety critical
  deployments. The presentation will focus on Xen on Arm, integration in Yocto and
  constraints specific to automotive. We will cover what is available in meta-arm
  today and show our vision of how the platform could evolve though collaboration
  with the Linaro members.'
