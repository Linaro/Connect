  <br>Fujitsu developed the A64FX processor that is optimized for HPC (High Performance
  Computing) and the AI(Artificial Intelligence).<br>A64FX is used in Fugaku supercomputer
  which is a massively parallel supercomputer and a successor to K-computer.<br>A64FX
  is based on&nbsp;Fujitsu&nbsp;microarchitecture, as used in our SPARC64 and mainframe
  processor development.<br>It provides the world''s top-class flops/watt, computing
  performance and memory bandwidth. A64FX Prototype took 1st place in the&nbsp;Green500
  November 2019.<br>To achieve high performance and low power consumption in a wide
  range of actual applications, we collaboratively work with RIKEN&nbsp;(co-design).<br>For
  ISA (Instruction Set Architecture),&nbsp;Fujitsu&nbsp;chose to adopt the Armv8-A
  with SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) to best position&nbsp;the Fugaku to utilize
  and contribute to a broader user base.<br>Fujitsu&nbsp;has collaborated with Arm
  as a lead partner and contributed to the development of SVE of the HPC and AI extension
  for the&nbsp;Armv8-A.<br>I would explain the processor features from the standpoint
  of microarchitecture and ISA.'
