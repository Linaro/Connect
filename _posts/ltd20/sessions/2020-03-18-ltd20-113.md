description: As the kernel keeps changing over the years, it's time to take a fresh
  look at what SoC support is present in the kernel for ARM and other architectures.<br><br>Interesting
  trends are how arm64 is slowly taking over from arm32, how both have taken over
  from almost all the other architectures over the years, and how new architectures
  are coming along.
