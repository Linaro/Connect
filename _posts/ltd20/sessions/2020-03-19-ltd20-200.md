  session will present a proposed technical architecture for enabling the dynamic
  configuration of heterogeneous platforms. The proposal defines extensions to the
  software management and deployment framework defined by the Open Container Initiative
  (OCI). The proposed extensions enable a standards-based method for scalable configuration
  inclusive of acceleration elements (e.g. FPGA-based accelerators, vector processor
  array accelerators, and asymmetric processing accelerator/offload targets (DSP,
  RPU)). The proposed OCI extensions would also enable greater flexibility in runtime
  software deployment on target, including “secure containers” via Xen, allowing each
  container to run as an isolated virtual machine (VM).<br><br>This standardization
  of configuration information will enable OCI-compliant container daemons to have
  a scalable abstraction to:<br>(1) interpret hardware acceleration and VM components
  within an OCI package<br>(2) understand the runtime requirements<br>(3) configure
  a heterogeneous target as part of the application container deployment process<br><br>The
  session has two goals. The first is to provide an overview of current proposal and
  collaborations around creating the extensions to the OCI Image Specification. The
  second is to discuss progress on technical prototyping of the OCI extensions. Both
  the hardware accelerator aware container and Xen secure container support are under
  discussion as potential Linaro Big Idea (LBI) projects.'

- speaker_bio: Wes is a Principal Engineer for Xilinx, focused on systems engineering
    of heterogeneous platform architectures, mixed criticality, and embedded design.
    He joined Xilinx in 2018 after 15+ years of product design leadership in hardware,
    FPGA, and mixed software environments of embedded systems. Application focus has
    been real-time control systems for a variety of products including magnetic resonance
    imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), subsea controllers, and industrial control
    systems.
