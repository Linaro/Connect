description: Fujitsu&nbsp;developed the A64FX processor that is optimized for HPC
  (High Performance Computing) and the AI(Artificial Intelligence).<br>A64FX is used
  in Fugaku supercomputer which is a massively parallel supercomputer and a successor
  to K-computer.<br>A64FX is based on&nbsp;Fujitsu&nbsp;microarchitecture, as used
  in our SPARC64 and mainframe processor development.<br>It provides the worlds top-class
  flops/watt, computing performance and memory bandwidth. A64FX Prototype took 1st
  place in the&nbsp;Green500 November 2019.<br>To achieve high performance and low
  power consumption in a wide range of actual applications, we collaboratively work
  with RIKEN&nbsp;(co-design).<br>For ISA (Instruction Set Architecture),&nbsp;Fujitsu&nbsp;chose
  to adopt the Armv8-A with SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) to best position&nbsp;the
  Fugaku to utilize and contribute to a broader user base.<br>Fujitsu&nbsp;has collaborated
  with Arm as a lead partner and contributed to the development of SVE of the HPC
  and AI extension for the&nbsp;Armv8-A.<br>I would explain the processor features
  from the standpoint of microarchitecture and ISA.
