  </strong><br>In a world of a trillion connected devices, Firmware security must
  be seen as a shared responsibility across different market segments, from Cloud
  to IoT. Trusted Firmware is an open governance community project, providing a collaborative
  platform for everyone in the ecosystem to work together on open source reference
  implementations of Secure world Software & Firmware on the Arm architecture, for
  both resource-constrained Microcontrollers and powerful Application Processors.<br>In
  this talk Matteo and Shebu will present the latest exciting news from the project,
  showing the constantly increased community engagement and discussing both recent
  updates and forward-looking plans for Trusted Firmware, as the comprehensive reference
  implementation for secure world software and secure services on Arm systems.'
