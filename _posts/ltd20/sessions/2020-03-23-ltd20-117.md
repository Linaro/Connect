  is a modern programming language designed from its inception to solve whole classes
  of problems that contribute to safety and security vulnerabilities. That, without
  sacrificing expressiveness, programmer convenience, performance and inter-operability
  with legacy code.<br><br>Today Rust is rapidly turning into the first choice for
  developing code intended to run in high performance, concurrent and safety critical
  environments. This is happening at all layers of the software stack including firmware,
  TEEs, OS kernels, web frameworks, the lot with contributions from all the usual
  (big) suspect organisations.<br><br>The story of the inception, design, development,
  evolution and uptake of Rust is a very interesting tale that sheds light on the
  real problems facing programming in the large in the face of todays safety and security
  landscape.<br><br>In this joint talk by Florian Gilcher (from Ferrous Systems and
  a member of the Rust language core team) and Robin Randhawa (from Arm, a long time
  friend of Linaro who focuses on the intersection of open source and safety) the
  audience will learn about the motivations and history of Rust, how it manages to
  do what it does and the plans for making Arm support in Rust be best in class.'
