  <br><br>Virtualization is becoming one of the key technologies to improve the safety
  and reduce development costs on the automotive space as it allows for mixed criticality
  workloads and the consolidation of ECUs under a common system.<br>We will present
  the Automotive reference stack, a collection of Yocto layers to build a platform
  suitable for safety critical deployments. The presentation will focus on Xen on
  Arm, integration in Yocto and constraints specific to automotive. We will cover
  what is available in meta-arm today and show our vision of how the platform could
  evolve though collaboration with the Linaro members.'
