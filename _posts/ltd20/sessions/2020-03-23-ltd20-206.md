  have developed an open distributed embedded platform prototype that targets automotive
  traffic monitoring across multiple CAN bus networks. This ecosystem interconnects
  multiple Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., RPI1, RPI2) to an Odroid XU3 which serves as
  a gateway node. CAN interconnection is based a) for Raspberry Pi, on IndustrialBerrys
  CANberry Dual V2.1 device, and b) for Odroid XU3, on two (incoming/outgoing) USB-to-CAN
  interfaces based on Scantool’s OBD Dev Kit (with STN2120 chipset). Our embedded
  software toolchain uses a) for RPI, Linux can-utils tools, and b) for Odroid XU3,
  an extended serial terminal code that uses multiple POSIX threads to manage incoming
  and outgoing CAN connections; gateway configuration and packet send/receive functions
  are based on USB-to-serial STN2120’s ELM327 AT and ST commands. During normal operation,
  RPI2 (CAN2) carries actual engine traffic (based on Korean dataset -- http://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Dataset/CAN-intrusion-dataset),
  while at the same time RPI1 requests, related to on-screen display depart from RPI1
  (CAN1), are received from RPI2 (CAN2) via the Gateway, and then, answered back to
  RPI1 (closing a round trip). In our threat model, we carry out a denial-of-service
  (DoS) attack on the CAN1 gateway interface and examine different metrics that can
  possibly be used in order to detect the attack. At gateway-level, three non-intrusive
  DoS attack metrics considered are related to a) the frequency of CAN packets per
  ID, b) energy consumption of the Cortex-A15 cores (available via I2C from integrated
  INA231 sensors), and c) temperature gradients related to the four thermal zones
  (available via I2C from integrated sensors). In addition, variations of round-trip
  times (RTT) for packets that flow from RPI1 to RPI2 (via Odroid XU3), and back to
  RPI1 can be measured. Our results indicate significant tradeoffs related to the
  accuracy of the four proposed detection metrics, with the energy metric appearing
  to provide the highest assurance, i.e., the lowest false-positive/negative ratio
  for a given attacker injection rate. Prediction of an attack effectively triggers
  throttling down, shutting down, or sleeping the outgoing interface, thus safeguarding
  engine ECU nodes. Our open source software code will become available soon in sourceforge.net'

- speaker_bio: 'Miltos D. Grammatikakis received MSc (1985) and PhD (1991) in Computer
    Science from the University of Oklahoma. After holding a number of positions with
    Academia, research and industry in France, Germany and Greece, he is now a professor
    at TEI of Crete. He has participated in 22 European projects (H2020, FP7, FP6,
    IST, ARTEMIS, ENIAC, MEDEA+, ESPRIT, TEN TELECOM, TMR, EURESCOM), and national
    R&D projects dealing with embedded and real-time systems, parallel and multicore
    architectures, EDA, high-level power estimation, reliability, security, and distributed
    systems for telecom and satellite networks. He has collaborated externally with
    ST Microelectronics for twenty years, e.g. on the IPSIM environment for system-level
    SoC modeling, the award-winning open source on-chip communication network framework
    (OCCN) available from http://occn.sourceforge.net) and Spidergon STNoC design.
    He has published more than 70 technical articles in edited books, international
    journals and conference proceedings, and is a co-author of two scientific books
    published by CRC Press (Taylor & Francis): “Parallel Systems: Communications and
    Interconnects” in 2001 and “Design of Cost-Efficient Interconnect Processing Units:
    Spidergon STNoC” in 2008.'
