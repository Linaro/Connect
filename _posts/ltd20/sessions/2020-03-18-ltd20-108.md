description: 'Arm has been releasing binary toolchains for Arm CPU processors based
  on GNU tools, which are used widely to develop for IoT, embedded and Linux. The
  releases happened a few times each year, following the annual tick of GCC. They
  were built from a set of scripts developed internally within Arm.<br><br>Such a
  release model works fine but has several problems. The most critical problem, raised
  by Linaro partners, is the cadence of release: there are too few releases for users
  to timely access new features and bug fixes in toolchain. As number of release will
  not increase without consuming more engineering resource in house, which is tight,
  users have to wait up to 6 months for a bug fix release. Also even when there is
  release to happen, lack of access to pre-view or alpha release, similarly due to
  resource constraint, prevents partners to integrate the toolchain in advance. Lastly
  but very importantly, when partners would like to contribute to build script to
  improve the release, they don''t have a way to do so.<br><br>Our solution is to
  open up the build scripts in a github project, together with supplement mechanism
  to prepare the build environment and pick-up the right revision of toolchain components.
  With this project, users can easily clone and build toolchain for Arm, with timely
  access to latest features and bug fixes published by tools developers. It will also
  incorporate contribution from community to enhance the toolchain for wider use cases.<br><br>This
  solution is under deployment stage and is expected to be ready before BUD20, which
  will be a good opportunity to improve awareness and encourage contribution. In this
  section, the presenter will introduce the structure and design principle of the
  github project, and demonstrate how to use and contribute to it.'
