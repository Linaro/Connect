  session is about the last main developments on I/O control and I/O testing, in the
  upstream Linux kernel. In more detail, we will cover: the adoption of the BFQ I/O
  scheduler in new systems, the new developments in the comparison among BFQ and the
  new Linux I/O controllers, and the last developments in I/O testing within the LKFT
  project.'

- speaker_bio: Versatile R&amp;amp;D professional with 6 years experience in software
    development for embedded systems and their special requirements, with a large
    knowledge base of how to troubleshoot complex real time systems. The technical
    competence is built mostly upon R&amp;amp;D within embedded systems in both telecommunication
    (e.g. base stations, media gateways) and automotive systems (e.g. engine-, gearbox-platforms).

- speaker_bio: Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
    University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and a collaborator of the Linaro
    engineering organization. Paolo&#39;s main activities focus on scheduling algorithms
    for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs. In this respect, Paolo is the
    author of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler. BFQ entered the Linux kernel
    from 4.12, providing unprecedented low-latency and fairness guarantees. As for
    transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which
    has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+,
    a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Finally, Paolo has
    also defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD,
    and has provided new theoretic results on multiprocessor scheduling.&lt;br&gt;
