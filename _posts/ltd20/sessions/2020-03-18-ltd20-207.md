description: Arm hardware and firmware standards are the foundational pillars for
  Arm servers, and a major reason for the early successes and continued investment
  and growth of this horizontally-integrated ecosystem. Non-server "Edge" systems,
  however, are still an embedded-style vertically-integrated market, which is getting
  in the way of massive adoption and proliferation of Edge/IoT Compute. So let's make
  the Edge systems standards compliant and start with the highest-volume and better
  known platform of them all - the Raspberry Pi! Let's teach the Pi how to boot off-the-shelf
  SBBR -compliant Linux, *BSDs and of course VMware ESXi-Arm and Microsoft Windows.<br><br>Even
  if you don't care about IoT, getting this class of devices to be standards-compliant
  will provide developers, tech evangelists and early adopters with $50-$100 ServerReady
  platforms, solving a real headache today around pricing/availability of systems
  in the market.<br><br>This is a technical presentation (and demo) on VMware's and
  Arm's joint open efforts to bring Arm ServerReady experiences to the Pi 4 as community-developed
  SBBR firmware, as part of the larger narrative that SBSA/SBBR is perhaps even more
  important at the Edge than it is in the Cloud or on-prem. The session covers the
  history of the Pi UEFI port, current status and technical challenges that remain
  to be solved.<br><br>The point of this session is to build community interest/participation
  in this effort and other efforts to make Edge systems ServerReady, such as Arm's
  Project Cassini. If we can do it on the Pi, we can do it on other Arm boards too.
