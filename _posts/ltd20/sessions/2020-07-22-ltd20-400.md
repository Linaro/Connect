  and Weston have now been shipping in commercial devices for eight years, since the
  first set-top box shipped with Wayland and Weston''s 0.85 release.<br><br>Considered
  a dramatic and difficult bet at the time, Wayland has in a short time become the
  de-facto choice across the industry. Not only is it seen everything from set-top
  boxes to smart TVs to smart watches, but its extensible and flexible nature means
  that it is even used to support Android applications within Google''s ChromeOS,
  running as a component of the Chromium browser engine. More complex usecases such
  as remote-display sharing and even VR environments are using Wayland as a building
  block.<br><br>Many of these devices are using the Weston display server, developed
  alongside the original Wayland implementation. Weston performs a careful balancing
  act, delivering as much of the capability of the underlying hardware as possible,
  whilst being uncompromising on quality. Weston''s efficient architecture and quality
  has seen it ship in many cases where reliability and responsiveness are non-negotiable.
  Thanks to its internal architecture making full use of the hardware''s capability,
  Weston is often used as a vehicle for introducing new features to the upstream graphics
  stack, as it can be easily adapted to take full advantage of new and more efficient
  hardware offload functionality.<br><br>In this talk, Daniel, a core Wayland developer
  at Collabora, will share some of the lessons of the last eight years of helping
  partners and the community successfully ship devices fulfilling Wayland''s original
  promise of ''every frame is perfect'', including lessons from what Wayland did well,
  things that would be very different in Wayland 2.0, and a look to future usecases
  and challenges for the whole graphics stack. He will also run through some real-life
  practical examples of closing the gap between prototype and production, using powerful
  profiling and introspection tools provided in recent versions of Weston.'
