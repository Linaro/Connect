description: Virtualization is becoming one of the key technologies to improve the
  safety and reduce development costs on the automotive space as it allows for mixed
  criticality workloads and the consolidation of ECUs under a common system.<br>We
  will present the Automotive reference stack, a collection of Yocto layers to build
  a platform suitable for safety critical deployments. The presentation will focus
  on Xen on Arm, integration in Yocto and constraints specific to automotive. We will
  cover what is available in meta-arm today and show our vision of how the platform
  could evolve though collaboration with the Linaro members.
