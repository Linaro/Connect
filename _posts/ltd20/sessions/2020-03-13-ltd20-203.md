description: Empowering Edge Software Stack on Arm with High Performance Container
  Networking Technology<br><br>The purpose of edge computing and MEC is to bring real-time,
  high-bandwidth, low-latency access to latency-dependent applications, distributed
  at the edge of the network. Arm put special design consideration for edge computing
  into its CPU architecture and reference SoC.<br>On the other side, a high performance,
  flexible and easy deployable container networking of edge software stack is the
  key to the success of using Arm platform on edge computing.<br>In the presentation,
  we would like to give out our R&D work on Arm edge software stack. The following
  key takeaways would given but not limit to:<br>1. The Arm edge reference stack,
  use cases and its supporting technologies;<br>2. The high performance container
  networking technology used in Arm edge software stack, which includes Calico(kernel
  stack based), Cilium(bpf based), SRIOV device plugin and CNI with kernel and DPDK
  support(physical device based)<br>3. The SmartNIC for container networking with
  SRIOV and OVS offload<br>4. The data plane acceleration technique used for edge
  computing on arm<br>5. Performance evaluation, comparisons and optimization from
  the edge application aspect for above technologies
