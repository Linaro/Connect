description: Arm has announced plans for a CHERI project to enable experimentation
  with a new Arm prototype security architecture. This presentation discusses how
  Arm will work with Linaro to provide software stacks to support planned development
  platforms. We provide a brief introduction to the scope and timelines for the work
  and discuss why the approach differs from the usual upstream mentality.
