  heterogeneous SoCs are very hard to configure. Issues such as which cores, memory
  and devices belong to which operating systems, hypervisors and firmware is done
  in an ad-hoc, error prone way. Even harder is to set up shared resources, e.g. shared
  pages for virtio.<br><br>System Device Trees will change all that by extending todays
  device trees, used by Linux, Xen, U-Boot, etc. to describe the full system and also
  include configuration information on what belongs where. This will enable any operating
  environment, including open source and proprietary Real-Time Operating Systems to
  be configured form one true source. System Device Trees are part of the Linaro Device
  Tree Evolution Project.<br><br>This talk will discuss the progress that has been
  made up to date, both in terms of specification as well as tooling. The open source
  Lopper tool will be demonstrated with different backends to show how to "prune"
  the System Device Tree to a traditional Device Tree as well as generating "#define"
  information usable for an RTOS.'
