  <br><br>Virtio is a framework that specifies how certain class of IO devices can
  be<br>accessed in virtual environments. Virtio devices are typically implemented
  in<br>software, which has a front-end portion that runs in guest OS context and
  a<br>backend portion which runs in a context outside of that guest OS. In case of<br>Type-2
  hypervisor like KVM, backend portion runs in the context of a VMM (Qemu,<br>LKVM
  etc) or in some cases KVM host kenrel itself. In case of Type-1 hypervisors<br>like
  Xen or ACRN, backend runs in the context of another guest OS.<br><br>A crucial aspect
  of Virtio is memory access provided for backends. Typically<br>backends have read/write
  access to complete guest OS memory that is hosting the<br>front-end counterpart.
  Such wholesale access to memory is not desirable when a<br>guest OS is running security-sensitive
  applications. It is desireable to<br>restrict access for backend only to the regions
  required. How can that be best<br>accomplished while still adhering to the Virtio
  specification?<br><br>This discussion is based on Qualcomm''s efforts to implement
  virtio for a Linux<br>guest OS running on a Type-1 hypervisor. Frontend and backend
  portions of virtio<br>run in separate guest OS contexts. A very small portion of
  memory is shared<br>between the two guest OS. We present the changes done to virtio
  front-end<br>drivers to accomodate the memory-access limitations for backends. A
  further<br>limitation addressed is lack of support in hypervisor to trap virtio
  config<br>space access and have that be handled in backend. Instead suitable changes
  are<br>discussed how virtio-mmio transport can accommodate a message passing mechanism.<br>Finally
  we present the need for a new backend implementation that is hypervisor<br>agnostic
  and can handle various limitations presented by different hypervisors.'
