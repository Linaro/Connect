description: Today's heterogeneous SoCs are very hard to configure. Issues such as
  which cores, memory and devices belong to which operating systems, hypervisors and
  firmware is done in an ad-hoc, error prone way. Even harder is to set up shared
  resources, e.g. shared pages for virtio.<br><br>System Device Trees will change
  all that by extending today's device trees, used by Linux, Xen, U-Boot, etc. to
  describe the full system and also include configuration information on what belongs
  where. This will enable any operating environment, including open source and proprietary
  Real-Time Operating Systems to be configured form one true source. System Device
  Trees are part of the Linaro Device Tree Evolution Project.<br><br>This talk will
  discuss the progress that has been made up to date, both in terms of specification
  as well as tooling. The open source Lopper tool will be demonstrated with different
  backends to show how to "prune" the System Device Tree to a traditional Device Tree
  as well as generating "#define" information usable for an RTOS.
