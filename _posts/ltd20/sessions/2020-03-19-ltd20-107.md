  <br><br>This session is about the last main developments on I/O control and I/O
  testing, in the upstream Linux kernel. In more detail, we will cover: the adoption
  of the BFQ I/O scheduler in new systems, the new developments in the comparison
  among BFQ and the new Linux I/O controllers, and the last developments in I/O testing
  within the LKFT project.'

- speaker_bio: Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
    University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and a collaborator of the Linaro
    engineering organization. Paolo\&#39;s main activities focus on scheduling algorithms
    for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs. In this respect, Paolo is the
    author of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler. BFQ entered the Linux kernel
    from 4.12, providing unprecedented low-latency and fairness guarantees. As for
    transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which
    has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+,
    a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Finally, Paolo has
    also defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD,
    and has provided new theoretic results on multiprocessor scheduling.&lt;br&gt;
