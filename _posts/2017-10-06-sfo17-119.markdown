excerpt: As we know, container technology are the most eminent virtualization technology
  today. For ARM NFVI infrastructure, Kubernetes is used as the container orchestration
  engine with DPDK data plane acceleration for container networking. How to evaluate
  the performance metrics(throughput, latency, jitter) automatically with a built-in
  mechanism of the whole NFVI infrastructure is an important problem. On the other
  hand, for CI-CD purpose of our NFVI development work, how to efficiently measure,
  collect and analyze the performance data of the container networking environment
  for ARM container based NFVI infrastructure is also an important issue to deal with.
