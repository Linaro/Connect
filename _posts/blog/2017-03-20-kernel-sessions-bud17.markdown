**Session Name: **Implementing contiguous page hint for anonymous pages in user space – BUD17-305

**Abstract:**
Contiguous page hint is a feature in AArch32 and AArch64 which could decrease the number of TLB misses and improve the performance by sharing a single TLB entry across 16 4k pages whenever the pages are also physically contiguous. Currently, it is only used in hugetlb which limited the scenarios where it can be used. This session will share and discuss following things:
1. The current design of hugepage, transparent hugepage and page
Fault and proposal from Bamvor

2. Compare and analyze the performance of different designs, including
transparent hugepage, hugepage and Bamvor’ design.

3. Discuss the scenarios which are suitable for this work beyond the
enterprise.

**Speakers:** Bamvor Jian Zhang
**Track:** Kernel
**Session ID:** BUD17-305
