**Session Name:** Auto vectorization support in OpenJDK9 Hotspot C2 compiler – BUD17-117

**Abstract:**
OpenJDK is an implementation of the Java SE and Linaro has been involved into OpenJDK aarch64 support since 2014. In this session, we will take a look at auto vectorization support in the OpenJDK9 hotspot C2 compiler, especially the NEON support in AArch64 backend. Some potential optimization points of vectorization in OpenJDK9 Hotspot (especially for AArch64 backend) are also described.

**Speakers:** Stuart Monteith

**Session Name:** AOSP Toolchains – BUD17-202

**Abstract:**
LMG team, in collaboration with Toolchains team, has worked on multiple areas related to clang, gcc and native AOSP builds. Bero and Renato will take us through what has been done, and what we need to continue to do. This presentation will focus on LMG efforts around the following:

– Clang CI efforts

– Getting AOSP to build with gcc 6/7

– Building kernels with clang

– Native AOSP builds and development

**Session Name: **Introducing LLDB for linux on Arm and AArch64 – BUD17-310

**Abstract:**
This session provides an introduction of LLDB – Debugger from LLVM project and its status on Arm and AArch64 Linux. A brief overview of various components in LLDB will be presented with a focus on LLDB commandline and how LLDB can provide debugging experience similar or different from GDB.

**Session Name: **Navigating the ABI for the ARM Architecture – BUD17-318

**Abstract:**
The ABI for a platform is defined by a multi-layered series of documents, with the ARM specific parts are largely defined by the ABI for the ARM architecture. This presentation will describe the structure of the ABI documentation and some of the design principles used in its construction.

This presentation is aimed at software developers wanting to understand how to find information about the ABI, what they can rely upon and what they can extend

**Speakers:** Peter Smith
**Track:** Toolchain

**Session Name: **System Trace Tools – BUD17-324

**Abstract:**
In STMicroelectronics we developed a set of tools for an efficient exploitation of application system trace under Linux, which we decided to make open source. The presentation will focus first on the current OSS tool offer, show which improvements can be made, then present ST proposed solutions compatible with Linaro Coresight framework (KPtrace, System Trace and Profiling Tool Kit) and a stepwise upstreaming plan.

**Session Name: **HHVM on AArch64 – BUD17-400K1

**Abstract:**
HHVM is a high-performance, open source PHP execution engine developed at Facebook. It’s the fastest PHP runtime in the world, with support for PHP5, PHP7, and Hack—the programming language used for Facebook’s web server application logic. In addition to powering Facebook’s web tier, HHVM has also been adopted by other major services such as Wikipedia, Baidu, and Box.

HHVM uses just-in-time compilation to transform PHP and Hack source code into optimized machine code. Thanks to contributions from developers across the ARM community, HHVM can now target AArch64 in addition to x86-64 and successfully runs open source PHP frameworks like WordPress. Join us for an overview of HHVM, a quick demo, and some thoughts on where optimization efforts can go from here.
