**Session Name: **Mcuboot: A shared bootloader for IoT – BUD17-100

**Abstract:**
An important base for security is the beginning of the boot process. It is necessary to be able to verify signatures before upgrading images. This session will discuss the mcuboot project, the efforts to port this to Zephyr, and the functionality available. It will include a small demo of its functionality.

**Speakers:** David Brown
**Track:** LITE
**Session ID:** BUD17-100

**Session Name: **Scripting Languages in IoT: Challenges and Approaches – BUD17-104

**Abstract:**
Scripting languages is hot emerging topic in IoT. They allow easy learnability and rapid prototyping and further benefits (like production use) as they evolve. This session compares approaches of MicroPython and JerryScript/Zephyr.js projects and gives status update on their Zephyr RTOS ports.

**Session Name: **Porting the TI SimpleLink CC32xx WiFi stack to the Zephyr IoT OS – BUD17-112

**Abstract:**
The TI SimpleLink CC32xx family of MCUs provides an SoC and supporting SDK which completely offloads the WiFi stack onto an integrated network coprocessor. The SimpleLink SDK currently has no explicit support for the Zephyr IoT OS, but is designed to be portable. A native IP stack for Zephyr is currently under development, which includes an experimental IP offload option. This session reviews the challenges of integrating a vendor TCP/IP offload engine into an existing OS IP stack in general, and in particular, evaluates options for integrating the TI SimpleLink WiFi stack into Zephyr.

**Session Name: **Linux-wpan: IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN in the Linux Kernel – BUD17-120

**Abstract:**
Adding support for IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN to an embedded Linux system opens up new possibilities to communicate with tiny devices. The mainline kernel
supports the wireless protocols to connect such devices to the internet, acting as border router for such networks. This talk will show the current kernel support, how to enable and configure the subsystems to use it and how to communicate between Linux and IoT operating systems like RIOT, Contiki or Zephyr.

**Speakers:** Stefan Schmidt

**Session Name:** Building a reference IoT product with Zephyr – BUD17-405

**Abstract:**
An example of a reference IoT product can be thought of supporting several core technologies such as IPv4/IPv6, 6LoWPAN, Bluetooth LE and also several protocols such as MQTT, CoAP and LWM2M. Additional requirements such as having a complete secure boot and execution environment, besides being able to be securely updated with FOTA support are also critically important. This session will cover the development and challenges faced when producing a reference IoT product implementation with Zephyr, describing the state of the project, and the current gaps to productization.
