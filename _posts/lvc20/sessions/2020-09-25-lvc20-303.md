description: "<p>From being called the 'new gold / oil', Big data technologies from
  its peak hype cycle have now matured as quintessential technology that powers many
  of today&rsquo;s businesses and enterprises. Most companies have changed themselves
  from being data-generating to data-powered, making use of actionable data and business
  insights. Big data is not just one piece of technology (Hadoop or Spark), rather
  it is a huge ecosystem, an assembly line of technologies and processes. There has
  been an increase in focus on data science and machine learning as a logical next
  step of evolution of Big Data. Data Strategy governs the quality of the data which
  acts as a precursor to data science and machine learning.</p>\r\n<p>In this talk,
  we will look at where ARM stands in regards to having big data systems running in
  production. We will look at various achievements in the last few years and also
  understand where we stand currently in the process of making ARM as the first class
  citizen. We will also cover some of the pain points we have faced and what is important
  to work on in the near future and beyond.</p>\r\n<p>Please join if you would like
  to know the status of Linaro&rsquo;s BDDS team and its roadmap.</p>\r\n<br />"
