description: Arm NN is an accelerated inference engine for Arm CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs.<br>It
  executes ML algorithms on-device in order to make predictions based on input data.<br>Arm
  NN enables efficient translation of existing neural network frameworks, such as
  TensorFlow Lite,<br>TensorFlow, ONNX, and Caffe, allowing them to run efficiently
  and without modification across Arm Cortex-A CPUs,<br>Mali GPUs, and Ethos-N NPUs.
  This presentation will provide details of the new features that have been added
  to Arm NN from the 19.11 to 20.05 release.
