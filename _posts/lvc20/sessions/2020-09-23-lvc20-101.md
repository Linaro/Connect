description: 'Slack channel to chat with speaker: https://linaroconnect.slack.com/archives/C01AKEK4AVD<br><br>Description:<br>There
  are lots of data formats in the BigData world such as parquet file with Python(pandas),
  Spark dataframe, JSON, Avro, CSV, etc.<br><br>It would waste about 70-80% computation
  on data conversion and serialization/deserialization among different projects.<br><br>Apache
  Arrow addresses these issues and facilitates communication between many components
  with its high-speed in-memory representation for flat and hierarchical data. It
  would help to get 10-100x speedup on In-Memory analytics workloads.<br><br>Collaborating
  with Linaro LDCG, we validated Apache Arrow on Arm64 and delivered the Arm-related
  optimization for Arrow.<br>This session will cover an overview of Apache Arrow,
  a brief introduction to Arrow optimization with Arm crypto and Neon extension and
  patches status submitted to the community. You will see the benchmark statistics
  results and how to take advantage of ARMv8 characteristics to make your data fly.'
