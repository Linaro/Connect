description: Currently, one big gap between Arm64 and X86 cloud platform is that X86
  can provide much better instance migration experience than Arm64 platform. CPU comparison
  and CPU model capabilities have provided Arm64 VM with the ability to live migration
  among different hardware vendors. This function is the essential function of the
  data center. From the cloud management framework, we also need to consider the realization
  of supporting VM live migration. <br /> <br /> In this seesion, we will talk about
  what we have done in most widely used virtulization management tool - Libvirt to
  provide better live migration capabilities on Arm64 platform and also some details
  in the newest lightweight cloud management project such as Kubevirt. <br /> <br
  /> With live migration support on Arm64, it can finally benefit the cloud ecosystem
  for large scale datacenter scenarios which may use different Arm64 CPU architectures
  and vendors.<br />
