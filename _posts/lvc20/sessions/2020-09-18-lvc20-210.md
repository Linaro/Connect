description: Arm NN is a neural network inference engine developed by Arm and the
  Linaro Machine Learning initiative connecting popular frameworks such as TensorFlow,
  TF Lite, ONNX, or Caffe with the CPU, GPU or NPU on your device using Arm NNâ€™s backends.
  The new Python interface called PyArmNN makes this even easier by enabling Python
  and all its modules.<br /> <br /> The presentation takes you through the concepts
  of the Arm NN framework, dives deeper both into Python enablement, the usage, and
  into the different backends for acceleration on platforms such as Arm NEON, OpenCL,
  or having to develop a custom one.

- speaker_bio: Pavel currently develops accelerated ML backends running on GPU/NPUs
    and enables NXP&#39;s eIQ Machine Learning platform. He actively contributes to
    Linaro&#39;s Arm NN framework and as such he was one of the developers contributing
    to the Python enablement in its latest release. His past experiences involve the
    development of safety-critical RTOS/display systems for Honeywell Aerospace or
    image processing applications for photographers.
