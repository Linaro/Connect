description: The OpenAMP Linaro Community Project is focusing on standardizing aspects
  of embedded heterogeneous software through open source projects. OpenAMP currently
  has four working groups solving issues such as messaging (rpmsg and virtio), lifecycle
  management (remoteproc), configuration standardization (System Device Tree), application
  services, and common interfaces for hypervisors and AMP. This talk will give an
  update on what has taken place since the launch at Linaro Connect SAN19, the efforts
  going on within OpenAMP, future potential topics, and discuss how you can engage.
