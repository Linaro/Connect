description: This session is about Arm's Secure Partition Manager (SPM) for A-class
  devices. The SPM is the reference open-source S-EL2 firmware implementation for
  the recently introduced Armv8.4-SecEL2 / Secure EL2 virtualization extensions. It
  is based on Google's Hafnium hypervisor now transitioned to trustedfirmware.org.
  It leverages the Platform Security Architecture Firmware Framework for A-class (PSA
  FF-A) specification. The presentation deals with brief history and use cases, SPM
  architecture, project status and plans.
