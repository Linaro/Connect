description: ArmÂ® Firmware Framework for Armv8-A [1] describes a software architecture
  and interfaces that standardize isolation and communication between the various
  software components.<br>Depending on the framework configuration, OP-TEE can be
  deployed either as a Secure-EL1 Secure Partition managed by a Secure Partition Manager
  (SPM) executing at secure EL2, or can serve as an SPM for S-EL0 Secure Partitions.<br>In
  this session, we'll focus on the potential use cases for S-EL0 partitions, such
  as a basic set of Platform Security services (Crypto, Storage and Attestation),
  Standalone MM or an existing set of TAs, managed by OP-TEE as the partition manager
  core.<br>We'll cover the design considerations and implementation choices made for
  an initial prototype, some of the challenges encountered and the status of the work
  in progress to support multiple types of partitions within a single standard framework
  in OP-TEE.<br><br>[1] https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0077/a<br><br>
