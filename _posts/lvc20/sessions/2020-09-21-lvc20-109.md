  becomes increasingly popular in datacenter and telco. It can achieve high performance
  and rich feature networking, and release CPU resources on server.<br>In real deployment,
  OVS-DPDK on Arm based SmartNIC is one of the common networking solutions. In this
  presentation, we would demo two different SmartNICs for OVS-DPDK, and discuss the
  advantages introduced by Arm CPU as follows:<br>1. Flexible and programmable.<br>2.
  Highly efficient implementation for complex features difficult to be done by hardware.<br>3.
  Fully offloading, include control plane and management plane.'
