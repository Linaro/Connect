- speaker_bio: Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home
    computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating
    with a degree in Chemistry he&#39;s worked on a variety of projects including
    Fruit Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave
    systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with
    FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. For the last five years he&#39;s been working
    at Linaro helping improve QEMU&#39;s emulation features. A keen Emacs user he
    will happily answer questions and proselytise for the One True Editor (tm).
