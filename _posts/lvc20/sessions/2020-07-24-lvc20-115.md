description: Arm ecosystem is becoming much more popular in cloud native applications
  than ever before with its increasing wide use. Arm devotes to be a cloud native
  vendor and puts much resources to enable related projects on its platform. Container
  networking is the key to high performance connection for cloud native computing
  and there are a number of Container Networking Interface(CNI) solutions, such as
  Flannel, Calico, etc.<br /> In the presentation, we would like present our recent
  work result on the performance benchmarking and tuning on various CNIs of arm:<br
  /> 1. High performance evaluation environment and tools used for benchmarking;<br
  /> 2. Networking models used by CNIs which actually affect the final result;<br
  /> 3. Benchmarking metrics(IP, TCP/UDP, HTTP) and results of the various CNIs on
  arm<br /> 4. Comparison between CNIs and analysis to the bottleneck factors with
  the graph<br /> 5. Our performance tuning to them and their improvements<br /> from
  the Linux system and usage model aspects
