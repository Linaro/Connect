description: The Embedded Base Boot Requirements(EBBR) specification defines requirements
  for embedded systems to enable inter-operability between SoCs, hardware platforms,
  firmware implementations, and operating system distributions. EBBR is targeted at
  making operating system/distros agnostic to platform. Same operating system image
  should run on any hardware with a well-defined firmware interface which is EBBR
  compliant.<br><br>There has been a significant work going on in U-boot with regards
  to EBBR in the open-source community. Various features like bootefi are already
  available with many other features in queue.<br><br>This presentation aims at explaining
  how EBBR specifications gets mapped to NXP platforms and demonstrating EBBR compliance
  for NXP platform. The reference boot-architecture will be based on TFA, u-boot,
  device-trees, Linux and OPTEE (for secure uefi flow). This will demonstrate distros
  like SUSE running on NXP SoCs using bootefi command, secure uefi flow, etc<br><br>Also
  efforts are going to ensure that the U-boot is EBBR compliant by running FWTS, SCT
  for EBBR. The idea is to make the u-boot feature complete and can be demonstrated
  as EBBR compliance on NXP devices.

- speaker_bio: I am computer Science Engineering graduate with almost 18 years of
    continuous experience in Embedded systems, Linux BSP, Unix, operating system internals,
    device drivers, boot loaders, Flash, DDR, Ethernet, SATA, USB, wireless, networking,
    etc, and open source software. Very good hold on PowerPC and ARM architectures.
    Representing NXP in various open source projects of ARM ecosystem, distros and
    CIs like Linaro(LSK), Preempt RT, Yocto, SUSE..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been
    involved in various bring up, BSP code development and open source up-streaming
    of these BSPs for various NXP SoCs of QorIQ, Qonverge and Layerscape series. This
    includes MPC8323, MPC8360, P1020, P1010, P2020, BSC9131, BSC9132, B4860, T1040,
    LS2088A, LS1012A, LS1088A for u-boot and Linux. I have been working as software
    IP owner for various areas like TDM, ethernet, DDR, Flash controller, heterogenous
    systems, multicore, AMP, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently playing the role of
    System Software architect which involves SoC feasibility and laying out the BSP
    software architecture for the NXP devices for wireless, networking and IoT use
    cases. Key areas include Platform software, u-boot, linux and device drivers.
