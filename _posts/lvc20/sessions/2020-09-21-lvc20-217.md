  flow. In this class we will move through a series of poses meant to ease tension
  in the shoulders, chest, and back. These are areas in the body that are often stressed
  and over stretched while working at a computer or desk. Remember to bring something
  comfy to practice on, a mat, towel, or blanket!

- speaker_bio: Kassidy is a Registered Yoga Teacher and Licensed Massage Therapist.
    She began her journey with yoga in 2012. It started as a way to stretch, and ease
    the tension of every day stress. After a few classes she noticed the power of
    uniting movement with breath, and &amp;nbsp;the calming effect it had on the mind.
    Her yoga practice turned into a passion for kinesiology, and later inspired her
    to take a 200 hour yoga teacher training in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Since becoming
    registered in 2017 she has instructed classes in New Hampshire, Utah, and South
    Carolina. She is now a resident in Charleston South Carolina and enjoys practicing
    yoga on the beach!
