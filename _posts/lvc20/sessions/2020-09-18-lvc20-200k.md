description: Free, open source software is mainly founded on legal tools, like copyright,
  licenses. From a lawyer's perspective, that means "compliance". But I want to extend
  the concept of compliance, by outlining that complying with the rules means *respect*
  for other people's work and interest. With the paradigm shifting, with more and
  more workloads happening on the cloud, this is all the more a crucial point, needing
  respect, besides compliance.
