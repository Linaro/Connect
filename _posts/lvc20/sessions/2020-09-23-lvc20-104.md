description: "Raspberry Pis have been there like forever, and have sold like hot cakes
  for 8 years now. Lots of people have done very ambitious projects (self-driving
  robots, anyone?), and new ideas and projects surface every day. Be it building a
  supercomputer by stacking lots of SBCs, a bitcoin miner, a brewery system, home
  automation, a weather station, or any crazy idea, the only limit seems to be your
  imagination.<br><br>Of course, these little beasts can also be used as servers.
  For years, Docker has been used only on big servers, but after resin.io ported Docker
  to the Arm processor, everything changed.<br><br>Pretty cool to be able to run Docker
  on that kind of mini machines, but what kind of service could you run on Docker
  with so little memory? Lots of things in fact…<br><br>And what if you could get
  the best of both worlds? What could you do with a machine able to interact with
  hardware (\U0001F321️, \U0001F4F9 , \U0001F6A6) thanks to Docker? Could you transform
  your Raspberry Pi into an edge computing node, an IoT on steroids \U0001F4AA , or
  anything in between?"
