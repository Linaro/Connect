description: ONNX Runtime is an open source machine learning inference engine focused
  on running the widely adopted Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format models
  with best performance.<br /> This session will introduce the ONNX format and the
  ONNX Runtime project and will provide details about the new ACL and ArmNN execution
  providers for Arm architecture recently accepted upstrem, specific optimizations
  and future work.

- speaker_bio: Mihai (Mike) Caraman PhD is a machine learning architect for application
    processors and microcontrollers at NXP Semiconductors. He earned a bachelor&#39;s
    degree in Mathematics and Informatics in &#39;97 with a thesis on artificial neural
    networks. After a 10 years detour in the beautiful world of virtualization, with
    contributions to the Linux kernel open source project, definition of next-gen
    networking SoCs, presentations at KVM Forum and Embedded World conferences, he
    returned to his first love. He is interested in everything related to machine
    learning, in particular deep learning, from hardware accelerators, neural networks
    architectures, optimizations and security, frameworks, exchange formats, edge
    and cloud service blending.
