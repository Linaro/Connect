description: Autonomous vehicles are becoming a part of normal life as companies,
  universities and foundations are heavily investing in projects to aid its research
  and development. One such initiative that has taken up wide acceptance by the automotive
  community is Autoware Foundation. This project supports self-driving mobility and
  has been adopted by over 100 companies and 40 vehicles. 96Boards, Autoware Foundation
  and its members (Xilinx, AutoCore) have teamed up to design an Autonomous driving
  solution using a customized Ultra96 Board and the Autoware stack. Using a distributed
  system design we will demonstrate some of the key autonomous driving features, which
  will also have the potential to be deployed as an ADAS module.<br><br>The talk will
  describe in detail the design and implementation of the vision control unit of RoboCar
  covering the hardware, software features and performance capabilities. The vision
  perception unit performs the main perception tasks in autonomous driving including
  object detection, traffic light detection and self-parking. The algorithms and models
  are open source and have been implemented using Xilinx FPGAs on the Ultra96 boards.
  The design of the functional nodes in the autonomous vehicle is distributed in nature
  with the nodes talking to each other over a Distributed Data Service layer as a
  messaging middleware and a real-time kernel to coordinate the actions. We also demonstrate
  the capability of Ultra96 MPSoC technology to handle multiple channels of LVDS real-time
  camera and the integration with the Lidar/Radar point cloud fusion to feed into
  the decision making unit of the overall system.<br><br>The presentation will also
  cover an Open source AI framework (XTA) used for object detection using Yolov3-tiny
  model. The details of image capture and algorithm processing of the vision perception
  pipeline will be presented along with the performance measurements in each phase
  of the pipeline. We will also be illustrating the ability of the stack to update
  the software components and designs through OTA. It is envisioned that the core
  AI engine will require regular updates with the latest training values; hence a
  built-in platform level mechanism supporting such capability is essential for real-world
  deployment.
