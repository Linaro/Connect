description: System Device Tree is an ongoing effort to expand the scope of Device
  Tree to describe and configure modern heterogeneous SoCs, including multiple CPUs
  clusters, their views of the system, and the software running on them. System Device
  Tree comes with Lopper, an Open Source Python tool to read a System Device Tree
  and produce one traditional Device Tree for each software execution domain.<br><br>The
  System Device Tree specification progressed significantly in the last year. This
  presentation will provide an update on the latest developments, such as the new
  bindings for the description and configuration of bus firewalls. The talk will deep-dive
  into Lopper, its flexible plugins architecture, and explain how to use it with System
  Device Tree today. If time allows, some common System Device Tree and Lopper use
  cases will be demonstrated.
