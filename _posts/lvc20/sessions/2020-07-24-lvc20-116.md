description: Parsec is the Platform Abstraction for Security, an open-source initiative
  that aims to create simple, standardised, ergonomic software interfaces for interacting
  with hardware-backed security features on any platform in any programming language.
  Parsec has now been accepted by the Cloud Native Compute Foundation as a sandbox
  project, which makes this the ideal time to learn how to contribute - and there
  is plenty to do! This developer-focused session will provide an overview of the
  Parsec architecture and its long-term vision, along with a guided tour of the code
  base, and some pointers for getting started.

    that safer languages are the future of Systems Programming, he has worked on improving
    the support of Rust on some Arm architecture profiles.&lt;br /&gt; Now working
    way higher up in the stack but keeping the Rust theme around for new exciting,
    security-related, projects!
