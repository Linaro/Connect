description: 'Slack channel to chat with speaker during session broadcast: https://linaroconnect.slack.com/archives/G01AT82J85C<br><br>Abstract:
  The cloud and data centre industry is extremely standardised. You can buy any commercial
  off the shelf server and expect your choice of operating system or variant of Linux
  to just work. Why isn''t this the case for so many of the device edge and IoT devices?
  We need the same SBSA/SBBR standards and numerous others for provisioning and device
  management to ensure real success on the device edge in deployment, life cycle management
  and security or else we will fail!'
