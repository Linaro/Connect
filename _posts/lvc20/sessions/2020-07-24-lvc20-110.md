description: 'Due to the increasing complexity of SoCs, we''re now seeing lots of
  thermal sensors on the die to quickly detect hot spots and allow the OS to take
  steps to mitigate these events. The Linux thermal framework provides mechanisms
  such as inputs for better scheduling, frequency throttling, idle injection and turning
  on fans to prevent the silicon from getting damaged from overheating. This is also
  called as junction temperature management.<br /> <br /> The Linux thermal framework
  is also used for managing the skin temperature of a device - the temperature that
  users feel when they hold and use the device. However, this skin temperature management
  involves manual characterisation of performance states for devices such as CPU and
  GPU to the its effect on the skin temperature of the device.<br /> <br /> So the
  framework is doing two distinct tasks: preventing silicon damage and preventing
  skin burns for users by capping the power of a device. We feel these tasks should
  be handled by different frameworks.<br /> <br /> We''re currently experimenting
  the kernel''s energy model to dynamically build a hierarchy of power constraints
  and allow the platform integrator to set limits for each power domain using the
  powercap framework. This will allow the kernel to manage the power consumption (and
  hence dissipation) budget of the various devices on the Soc more autonomously, leading
  to better performance at a given power budget instead of overcoming the primary
  goal of the thermal framework which is mitigate at the limits.<br /> <br /> Attendees
  are expected to know a little bit about how the current thermal framework works,
  but don''t need to know all the technical details. We will cover the conceptual
  differences between the current and proposed models as an introduction in the talk.<br

- speaker_bio: Daniel worked in 1998 in the Space Industry and Air traffic management
    for distributed system project in life safety constraints. He acquired for this
    project a system programming expertise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He joined IBM
    in 2004 and since this date he does kernel hacking and pushed upstream the resource
    virtualization with the namespaces. He is the author and maintainer of the Linux
    Container (LXC).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In 2012, he joined Linaro to work in
    the power management team. Deeply involved in the power management improvements
    for the different members of Linaro, he continues to contribute and maintain some
    parts of the Linux kernel.

- speaker_bio: Amit works at Linaro and has been found dabbling in the upstream Linux
    community in the areas of power and thermal management. He was once found lost
    in the friendly Zephyr RTOS community for a bit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In the
    last decade, heâ€™s led the Power Management working group at Linaro, helped lead
    the 96boards.org effort to bring powerful developer boards at low-cost to the
    software community and helped several SoC vendors to work with the upstream community
    and help themselves along the way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; His main hobby these
    days is to learn to grow food.
