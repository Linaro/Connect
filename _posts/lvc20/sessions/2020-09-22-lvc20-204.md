description: 'Security solutions are typically constructed from many different components.
  Some security features offer confidentiality and integrity protection, whilst others
  are there to make it harder for an attacker to launch an attack. Encrypted firmware
  is a security feature to make it harder for an attacker to reverse engineer the
  firmware, making it more difficult to identify exploitable bugs and to providing
  confidentiality protection for software IP.<br><br>This session will discuss various
  aspects of firmware encryption like: Who should own the secret key? What should
  be the key type either device unique or class wide key? How firmware encryption
  plays nicely with authentication? Along with this we will discuss my recent work
  to add support for loading encrypted payloads in TF-A and OP-TEE.'
