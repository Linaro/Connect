description: The Embedded Base Boot Requirements(EBBR) specification defines requirements
  for embedded systems to enable inter-operability between SoCs, hardware platforms,
  firmware implementations, and operating system distributions. EBBR is targeted at
  making operating system/distros agnostic to platform. Same operating system image
  should run on any hardware with a well-defined firmware interface which is EBBR
  compliant.<br><br>There has been a significant work going on in U-boot with regards
  to EBBR in the open-source community. Various features like bootefi are already
  available with many other features in queue.<br><br>This presentation aims at explaining
  how EBBR specifications gets mapped to NXP platforms and demonstrating EBBR compliance
  for NXP platform. The reference boot-architecture will be based on TFA, u-boot,
  device-trees, Linux and OPTEE (for secure uefi flow). This will demonstrate distros
  like SUSE running on NXP SoCs using bootefi command, secure uefi flow, etc<br><br>Also
  efforts are going to ensure that the U-boot is EBBR compliant by running FWTS, SCT
  for EBBR. The idea is to make the u-boot feature complete and can be demonstrated
  as EBBR compliance on NXP devices.
