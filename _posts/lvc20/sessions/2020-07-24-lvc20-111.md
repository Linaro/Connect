description: Arm servers, an important player in data center technology, are well
  suited for storage workloads. It's critical to explore techniques to improve storage
  performance on Arm servers. This session shares practices to boost storage IO performance
  on Arm servers with SPDK, which get extremely high performance with techniques of
  running at user level, Poll Mode Drivers (PMDs) and shared-nothing design.<br />
  We have done much work to dig what SPDK brings for Arm servers, including using
  SPDK NVMe-over-RDMA to access remote NVMe devices, using SPDK OCF to enhance the
  low speed devices and SPDK Vhost to improve the IOs of virtual machines. And we
  collect many exciting profiling data to share. Besides, optimization has been made
  in base64, CRC and atomic operations utilizing Arm hardware features, which are
  also meaningful to other projects optimization on Arm.<br />
