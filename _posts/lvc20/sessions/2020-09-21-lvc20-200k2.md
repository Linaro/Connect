description: SiPearl was founded in 2019 as the production hand of the European Processor
  Initiative. Now at 22 employees, we are growing fast to deploy our first generation
  processor, Rhea, as the cornerstone of European Exascale systems. In this talk we
  provide an overview of SiPearl and our objectives and discuss some of the top level
  architecture choices and KPI to address our target markets. A fundamental for the
  selection of Arm is the server software and partner ecosystem that has grown steadily
  over the years thanks to the user community with the help of organizations such
  as Linaro.
