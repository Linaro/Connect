description: Arm ServerReady has been instrumental to making Arm servers a consistent
  and reliable platform for OS vendors and end users. By providing testing tools and
  a certification program ServerReady gave hardware vendors the tools they need to
  create products that just work with enterprise OSes.<br /> <br /> In the embedded
  Linux ecosystem, firmware projects are adopting some of the same interfaces that
  are already standard on Arm servers, such as UEFI, Secure Boot, Capsule Update,
  and TPM. Using the same interfaces reduces the engineering required to provision
  and manage embedded devices by leveraging the same tooling and making the platform
  interface consistent.<br /> <br /> However, unlike in the server space with ServerReady,
  there isn't a compliance test program for embedded platforms, which makes it difficult
  to know how well a given platform implements the standard interfaces. In this presentation
  we'll explore what testing is available for embedded platforms and what could be
  provided as tooling for embedded platform compliance.
