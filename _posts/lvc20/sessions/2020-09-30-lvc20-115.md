description: Arm ecosystem is becoming much more popular in cloud native applications
  than ever before with its increasing wide use. Arm devotes to be a cloud native
  vendor and puts much resources to enable related projects on its platform. Container
  networking is the key to high performance connection for cloud native computing
  and there are a number of Container Networking Interface(CNI) solutions, such as
  Flannel, Calico, etc.<br>In the presentation, we would like present our recent work
  result on the performance benchmarking and tuning on various CNIs of arm:<br>1.
  High performance evaluation environment and tools used for benchmarking;<br>2. Networking
  models used by CNIs which actually affect the final result;<br>3. Benchmarking metrics(IP,
  TCP/UDP, HTTP) and results of the various CNIs on arm<br>4. Comparison between CNIs
  and analysis to the bottleneck factors with the graph<br>5. Our performance tuning
  to them and their improvements<br>from the Linux system and usage model aspects

- speaker_bio: Trevor Tao(Zijin Tao) is a Ph.D in Computer Networking, who has worked
    in this area for more than 15 years. He has worked as a network engineer in research
    institute of university for more than 10 years. Then he worked in IBM for almost
    5 years for SDN and Cloud Networking. Now he is working in Arm as an Staff Software
    Engineer, mainly major open source projects for cloud native and edge computing.
    He had enabled some CNI solutions on arm platform, such as Contiv/VPP, OVN-Kubernetes,
    etc. Now he is a PTL of IEC blueprint of Akraino under LF edge. He had given out
    edge computing reference stack and solution on arm platform. Trevor Tao (Zijin
    Tao) has filed more than 10 patents and papers in Computer Networking.
