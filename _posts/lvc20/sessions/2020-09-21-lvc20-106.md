description: On 32-bit Linux machines, the 4GB of virtual memory are usually split
  between 3GB address space for user processes and a little under 1GB directly mapped
  physical memory.<br><br>While kernels can address more physical memory than what
  is directly mapped, this requires the "highmem" feature that is likely going away
  in the long run, while there are still systems using 32-bit ARM Linux with 2GB or
  more that should get kernel updates for many years to come.<br><br>As an alternative
  to highmem, we are proposing a new way to split the available virtual memory, giving
  3.75GB of address space to both user space and to the linear physical memory mapping.<br><br>In
  this presentation, we discuss the state of those patches and the trade-offs we found
  for performance, security and compatibility with existing systems.
