description: System Device Tree is an ongoing effort to expand the scope of Device
  Tree to describe and configure modern heterogeneous SoCs, including multiple CPUs
  clusters, their views of the system, and the software running on them. System Device
  Tree comes with Lopper, an Open Source Python tool to read a System Device Tree
  and produce one traditional Device Tree for each software execution domain.<br />
  <br /> The System Device Tree specification progressed significantly in the last
  year. This presentation will provide an update on the latest developments, such
  as the new bindings for the description and configuration of bus firewalls. The
  talk will deep-dive into Lopper, its flexible plugins architecture, and explain
  how to use it with System Device Tree today. If time allows, some common System
  Device Tree and Lopper use cases will be demonstrated.
