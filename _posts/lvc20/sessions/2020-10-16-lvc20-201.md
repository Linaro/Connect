description: Boot-time tracing is one of the latest Linux kernel tracing proposal,
  which allows us to trace kernel booting with full tracing features, like per-event
  filters and triggers, histograms, instances, dynamic-events etc. Along with the
  boot-time tracing the kernel command-line interface is also expanded by Extra Boot
  Config (XBC) so that user can specify complex boot-time settings with structured-key
  value configuration file.<br>This talk will show you what the boot-time tracing
  and the extra boot config provide, the advantages and how you can use it for your
  boot-time features.
