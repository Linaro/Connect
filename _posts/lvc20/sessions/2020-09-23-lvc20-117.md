description: 'Slack channel to chat with the speaker during the live broadcast: https://linaroconnect.slack.com/archives/C01B1SV18F5<br><br>Currently,
  one big gap between Arm64 and X86 cloud platforms is that X86 can provide a much
  better instance migration experience than the Arm64 platform. CPU comparison and
  CPU model capabilities have provided Arm64 VM with the ability to live migration
  among different hardware vendors. This function is the essential function of the
  data center. From the cloud management framework, we also need to consider the realization
  of supporting VM live migration.<br><br>In this session, we will talk about what
  we have done in the most widely used virtualization management tool - Libvirt to
  provide better live migration capabilities on Arm64 platform and also some details
  in the newest lightweight cloud management project such as Kubevirt.<br><br>With
  live migration support on Arm64, it can finally benefit the cloud ecosystem for
  large scale datacenter scenarios which may use different Arm64 CPU architectures
  and vendors.'
