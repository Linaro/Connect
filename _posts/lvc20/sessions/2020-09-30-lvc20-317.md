description: Each seismic survey in Oil & Gas exploration generates tons of seismic
  wave data, typically hundreds of Terabytes. Transforming the huge amount of data
  into a accurate earth subsurface model requires exascale level computing power.
  This presentation will analyze the computing requirements and trends in seismic
  data processing, evaluate the competence of the current generations ARM64 SoCs and
  the new features required.
