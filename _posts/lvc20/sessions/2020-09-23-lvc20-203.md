description: A satellite management controller (MC) on a server platform interfaces
  with a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) enabling the platform to be remotely
  managed and monitored. The communication between the satellite MC and the BMC use
  protocols defined by DMTF PMCI working group and includes the PLDM and MCTP protocols.<br><br>This
  presentation talks about the integration of OpenBMC project’s PLDM and MCTP libraries
  on Arm’s Neoverse Reference Design platforms to allow the interfacing of this platform
  with a BMC. The Neoverse Reference Design platform includes a satellite management
  controller and these libraries execute as firmware extensions on this controller.
  This firmware stack processes PLDM requests, reads the Platform Data Records (PDR)
  on the platform, encodes this information as a PLDM response and returns it to the
  BMC. A PLDM message loop-back mechanism is used to simplify the validation of message
  generation and response. This enables the MC to handle RAS error logging, monitoring
  and control and remote debug communication with the BMC. Key takeaways for the audience
  include introduction to PMCI defined messaging between MC and BMC and details of
  integration and usage of PLDM/MCTP libraries on MC of the Neoverse reference design
  platform.
