description: Sound Open Firmware is an open source audio DSP firmware and SDK that
  provides audio firmware infrastructure and development tools for developers and
  software integrators that are interested in audio or signal processing on DSPs.<br
  /> <br /> This presentation is about the status of enabling Sound Open Firmware
  on i.MX8 boards. This includes code for Application Processor which usually runs
  Linux kernel and code for DSP core which runs the firmware.<br /> <br /> First platform
  using Sound Open Firmware on ARM is NXP's i.MX8QXP.
