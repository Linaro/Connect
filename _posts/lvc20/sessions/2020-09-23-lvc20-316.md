description: Containers are incredibly convenient to package applications and deploy
  them quickly across the data center.<br><br>This talk will introduce RunX, a new
  project under LF Edge that aims at bringing containers to the edge with extra benefits.
  At the core, RunX is an OCI-compatible container runtime to run software packaged
  as containers as Xen micro-VMs. RunX allows traditional containers to be executed
  with a minimal overhead as virtual machines, providing additional isolation and
  real-time support.<br><br>It also introduces new types of containers designed with
  edge and embedded deployments in mind. RunX enables RTOSes, and baremetal apps to
  be packaged as containers, delivered to the target using the powerful containers
  infrastructure, and deployed at runtime as Xen micro-VMs. Physical resources can
  be dynamically assigned to them, such as accelerators and FPGA blocks.<br><br>This
  presentation will go through the architecture of RunX and the new deployment scenarios
  it enables. It will provide an overview of the integration with Yocto Project via
  the meta-virtualization layer and describe how to build a complete system with Xen
  and RunX.<br><br>The presentation will come with a live demo on embedded hardware.

- speaker_bio: Stefano Stabellini serves as system software architect and virtualization
    lead at Xilinx, the world&#39;s largest supplier of FPGA solutions. Previously,
    at Aporeto, he created a virtualization-based security solution for containers
    and authored several security articles. As Senior Principal Software Engineer
    in Citrix, he led a small group of passionate engineers working on Open Source
    projects. Stefano has been involved in Xen development since 2007. He created
    libxenlight in November 2009 and started the Xen port to ARM with virtualization
    extensions in 2011. Today he is a Xen Project committer, and he maintains Xen
    on ARM and Xen support in Linux and QEMU.

- speaker_bio: Bruce Ashfield is currently a system software architect and Yocto technical
    lead at Xilinx, the worlds largest supplier of FPGA solutions. Previously, at
    Wind River, he created a embedded products based on the Yocto project. Bruce had
    a particular focus in virtualization and cloud native solutions, creating both
    a real time virtualization profile (Open Virtualization Profile) and a container
    based edge OS (OverC). Bruce continues as the kernel, meta-virtualization, meta-realtime
    and container maintainer for the Yocto project as well as working on System Device
    tree (among other things) at Xilinx.
