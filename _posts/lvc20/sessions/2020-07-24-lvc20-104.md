description: Raspberry Pis have been there like forever, and have sold like hot cakes
  for 8 years now. Lots of people have done very ambitious projects (self driving
  robot, anyone?), and new ideas and projects surface everyday. Be it building a supercomputer
  by stacking lots of SBCs, a bitcoin miner, a brewery system, home automation, a
  weather station or any crazy idea, the only limit seems to be your imagination.<br
  /> <br /> Of course, these little beasts can also be used as servers. For years,
  Docker has been used only on big servers, but after resin.io ported Docker to the
  Arm processor, everything changed.<br /> <br /> Pretty cool to be able to run Docker
  on that kind of mini machines, but what kind of service could you run on Docker
  with so little memory? Lots of things in fact…<br /> <br /> And what if you could
  get the best of both worlds? What could you do with a machine able to interact with
  hardware (🌡️, 📹 , 🚦) thanks to Docker? Could you transform your Raspberry Pi into
  an edge computing node, an IoT on steroids 💪 or anything in between?<br />
