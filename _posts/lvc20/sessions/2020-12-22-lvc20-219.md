- speaker_bio: Alex started learning to program in the 80s in an era of classic home
    computers that allowed you to get down and dirty at the system level. After graduating
    with a degree in Chemistry he&#39;s worked on a variety of projects including
    Fruit Machines, Line Cards, CCTV recorders and point-to-multipoint wireless microwave
    systems. Since the turn of the century his primary focus has been working with
    FLOSS platforms, especially Linux. For the last five years he&#39;s been working
    at Linaro helping improve QEMU&#39;s emulation features. A keen Emacs user he
    will happily answer questions and proselytise for the One True Editor (tm).

- speaker_bio: Azzedine Touzni is a Senior Director of Technology at Qualcomm, Inc.
    in San Diego, CA. &amp;nbsp;In recent years, his contributions have been focused
    on system software compute design, occupying a dual role of defining platform
    architecture and supporting commercial development. &amp;nbsp;Focusing equally
    on hardware and software design, his primary role is to lead CPU/DSP/infrastructure
    technologies teams, as well as to define technology roadmaps.&lt;br&gt;Although
    his recent contributions have been primarily to the design of top-tier mobile
    phones, he has also contributed to the product definition of Internet of Things
    devices and heterogenous compute products. He pioneered the first 64-bit Android
    smart phone, as well as other technological breakthroughs in system-on-chip security
    and infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;Prior to joining Qualcomm, Azzedine worked on a wide
    range of IC products in technical leadership and management roles in both start-ups
    and large technology companies, leading world-class system algorithm, firmware,
    and software organizations. He was influential in the standardization of new modulation
    techniques for wide-band RF spectrum receivers adopted by the Advanced Television
    Systems Committee and the Federal Communications Commission. He also defined and
    designed one of the first heterogenous integrated application processors with
    wide-band receivers in the industry.&lt;br&gt;Azzedine was a Fellow at Cornell
    University in Ithaca, NY, in the Electrical Engineering department. He was also
    affiliated with INRIA (Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique)
    in Paris, France. &amp;nbsp;He holds a Ph.D. in Statistical Estimation Theory
    from the UCP/CNRS UMR8051, Paris, France, and a master’s degree from the ENSEA
    (École Nationale Supérieure de l&#39;Electronique et de ses Applications), Paris,
    France.&lt;br&gt;Azzedine has authored more than 40 papers and contributed to
    and co-authored technical books.  He holds over 60 patents, primarily in signal
    processing and integrated system design.
