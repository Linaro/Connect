description: Increasingly, embedded devices are being equipped with ARM processors.
  Because of ease-of-use and widespread support for drivers and applications, Linux
  is often used as the OS of choice even though it consumes a significant amount of
  the device’s limited resources, and its large Trusted Compute Base (TCB) has resulted
  in a plethora of exploits. In this talk we will present Unikraft, a fully micro-library
  operating system and build tool which allows for building specialized OSes and software
  stacks targeting one application, while removing unneeded functionality. As a proof
  of concept, we port Unikraft to the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and to a Xilinx Ultra96-V2.
  On these boards, Unikraft is able to boot in 88-158 milliseconds, consume only hundreds
  of KBs of memory when running real-world applications such as NGINX and ML frameworks
  such as PyTorch, while providing visible reductions in power consumption compared
  to Linux distributions. Unikraft is a Linux Foundation open source project and can
  be found at www.unikraft.org .

- speaker_bio: I’m a chief researcher in the systems group at NEC Laboratories Europe
    in Heidelberg, Germany. My main research and work interests lie in the areas of
    high-performance software systems, and in particular specialization, virtualization,
    and the application of machine learning techniques to tackle open problems in
    the systems area. Previously, I received an undergraduate degree with honours
    from the University of Virginia, a Masters in Data Communications, Networks and
    Distributed Systems from University College London (top of the class), and a Ph.D.
    also from UCL. I have published on several top-tier conferences and journals such
    as SOSP, SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, and SIGCOMM CCR and regularly act as TPC member
    of conferences and journals such as IMC , INFOCOM, CoNEXT and SIGCOMM CCR.
