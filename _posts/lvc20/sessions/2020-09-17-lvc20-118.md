description: The System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is a set of operating
  system-independent software interfaces that has been originally specified to standardize
  the interface between Application Processors and the power coprocessor. But there
  are situations where we can't rely on such a power coprocessor. In such a case,
  the SCMI server has to run a secured partition like OP-TEE. This presentation will
  describe the status of our PoC of a SCMI server<br /> running as an OP-TEE TA. We
  will present the design, what is already available, the next features to be added
  and also how this could be extended to other UCs.

    coprocessors in mobile phones during 12 years. In 2005, he began to focus on mobile
    phones that ran Linux then Android and spent the last years of this period to
    optimize the power consumption of android platforms. As a member of the Linaro
    power management working group, he works on improving the energy efficiency of
    embedded system but not only with special interest for scheduler.
