description: Containers are incredibly convenient to package applications and deploy
  them quickly across the data center.<br /> <br /> This talk will introduce RunX,
  a new project under LF Edge that aims at bringing containers to the edge with extra
  benefits. At the core, RunX is an OCI-compatible containers runtime to run software
  packaged as containers as Xen micro-VMs. RunX allows traditional containers to be
  executed with minimal overhead as virtual machines, providing additional isolation
  and real-time support.<br /> <br /> It also introduces new types of containers designed
  with edge and embedded deployments in mind. RunX enables RTOSes, and baremetal apps
  to be packaged as containers, delivered to the target using the powerful containers
  infrastructure, and deployed at runtime as Xen micro-VMs. Physical resources can
  be dynamically assigned to them, such as accelerators and FPGA blocks.<br /> <br
  /> This presentation will go through the architecture of RunX and the new deployment
  scenarios it enables. It will provide an overview of the integration with Yocto
  Project via the meta-virtualization layer and describe how to build a complete system
  with Xen and RunX.<br /> <br /> The presentation will come with a live demo on embedded
  hardware.

- speaker_bio: Stefano Stabellini serves as system software architect and virtualization
    lead at Xilinx, the world&#39;s largest supplier of FPGA solutions. Previously,
    at Aporeto, he created a virtualization-based security solution for containers
    and authored several security articles. As Senior Principal Software Engineer
    in Citrix, he led a small group of passionate engineers working on Open Source
    projects. Stefano has been involved in Xen development since 2007. He created
    libxenlight in November 2009 and started the Xen port to ARM with virtualization
    extensions in 2011. Today he is a Xen Project committer, and he maintains Xen
    on ARM and Xen support in Linux and QEMU.
