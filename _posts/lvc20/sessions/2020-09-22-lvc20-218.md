description: BoF session to discuss recent changes and current issues in gpio and
  pinctrl. For GPIO, we have new uAPI in the works and also the recent GPIO aggregator.
  For pinctrl, gpiod is starting to incorporate certain pinctrl aspects like bias.
  Linus Walleij, who is the maintainer, told me he thought is would be a good idea
  and agreed to attend if I organize it.
