description: 96Boards team and partners like Arrow Electronics worked hard to promote,
  and make 96Boards visible in the embedded designer community. During this session
  I am inviting the audience for an open discussion on how to make the 96Boards more
  popular, more competitive against the standard development platforms / board makers.
