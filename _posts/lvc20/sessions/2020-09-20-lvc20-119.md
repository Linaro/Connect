description: The ARM SCMI specification provides a standardized interface for OS/Firmware
  coordinated power management. SCMI has been adopted today for platforms primarily
  targeted at the mobile/client/embedded segment. As Arm-based SoCs increasingly find
  their way into Infrastructure and Automotive, standardizing Power Management in
  products targeted at these segments becomes a necessity to prevent software fragmentation.<br><br>In
  this session we will explore how SCMI can be extended to standardize power management
  for Arm-based SoCs targeted at Infrastructure and Automotive. We will look at how
  SCMI can work through ACPI which is commonly used in most kernels targeted at the
  Infrastructure space. We would also have a look at how an Automotive Power Management
  stack can be setup with the help of SCMI.
