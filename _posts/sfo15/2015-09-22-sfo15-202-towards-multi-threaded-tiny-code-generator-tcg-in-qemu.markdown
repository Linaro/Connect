excerpt: 'While QEMU has continued to be optimised for KVM to make use of the growing
  number of cores on modern systems TCG emulation has been stuck running in a single
  thread. This year there is another push to get a workable solution merged upstream.
  We shall present a review of the challenges that need to be addressed: locking,
  TLB and cache maintenance and generic solution for the various atomic/exclusive
  operations. We will discuss previous work that has been done in this field before
  presenting a design that addresses these requirements. Finally we shall look at
  the current proposed patches and the design decisions they have taken.'

SFO15-202: Towards Multi-Threaded Tiny Code Generator (TCG) in QEMU
Speaker:  Alex Bennée
Date: September 22, 2015

★ Session Description ★
While QEMU has continued to be optimised for KVM to make use of the growing number of cores on modern systems, TCG emulation has been stuck running in a single thread. This year there is another push to get a workable solution merged upstream. We shall present a review of the challenges that need to be addressed: locking, TLB and cache maintenance and generic solution for the various atomic/exclusive operations. We will discuss previous work that has been done in this field before presenting a design that addresses these requirements. Finally we shall look at the current proposed patches and the design decisions they have taken.
