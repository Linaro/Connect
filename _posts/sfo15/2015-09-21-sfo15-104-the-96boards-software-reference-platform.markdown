excerpt: "96Boards is most obviously a hardware specification and website providing
  support and access to software downloads. The software is, to a certain extent,
  taken for granted, but it is the software that differentiates 96Boards from many
  other development boards. This session will start with a brief introduction to the
  96Boards Software Reference Platform and then invite discussion about how to improve
  the platform and what should and shouldn\u2019t be a part of the platform across
  the range of boards."

SFO15-104: The 96Boards Software Reference Platform
Speaker: Yhang Zhang, George Grey
Date: September 21, 2015

★ Session Description ★
96Boards is most obviously a hardware specification and website providing support and access to software downloads. The software is, to a certain extent, taken for granted, but it is the software that differentiates 96Boards from many other development boards. This session will start with a brief introduction to the 96Boards Software Reference Platform and then invite discussion about how to improve the platform and what should and shouldn’t be a part of the platform across the range of boards.
