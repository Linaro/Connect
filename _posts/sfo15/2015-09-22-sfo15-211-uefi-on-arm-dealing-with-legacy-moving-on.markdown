excerpt: "This session will go through the problems caused by decisions made in the
  early days of UEFI on ARM, how they are still hurting us - in expanding our validation
  as well as by providing poor examples for porters to new platforms. But also about
  projects underway to resolve this legacy once and for all. We will also cover changes
  to Linaro\u2019s platform infrastructure, as well as our increasing involvement
  with EDK2 maintainership."

SFO15-211: UEFI on ARM - Dealing with legacy & moving on
Speaker:  Leif Lindholm
Date: September 22, 2015

★ Session Description ★
This session will go through the problems caused by decisions made in the early days of UEFI on ARM, how they are still hurting us - in expanding our validation as well as by providing poor examples for porters to new platforms. But also about projects underway to resolve this legacy once and for all. We will also cover changes to Linaro’s platform infrastructure, as well as our increasing involvement with EDK2 maintainership.
