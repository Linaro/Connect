excerpt: This session will go through the problems caused by decisions made in the
  early days of UEFI on Arm, how they are still hurting us - in expanding our validation
  as well as by providing poor examples for porters to new platforms. But also about
  projects underway to resolve this legacy once and for all. We will also cover changes
  to Linaro’s platform infrastructure, as well as our increasing involvement with
  EDK2 maintainership.

Speaker: Leif Lindholm
Date: September 22, 2015

★ Session Description ★
This session will go through the problems caused by decisions made in the early days of UEFI on Arm, how they are still hurting us - in expanding our validation as well as by providing poor examples for porters to new platforms. But also about projects underway to resolve this legacy once and for all. We will also cover changes to Linaro’s platform infrastructure, as well as our increasing involvement with EDK2 maintainership.
