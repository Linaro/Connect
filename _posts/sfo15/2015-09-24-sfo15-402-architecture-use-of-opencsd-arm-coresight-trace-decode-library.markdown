SFO15-402: Architecture & Use of “openCSD” Arm CoreSight Trace decode library
Speakers:  Tor Jeremiassen, Mike Leach
Date: September 24, 2015

★ Session Description ★
The openCSD project is developing an open source trace decode library for Arm CoreSight trace sources. When complete, this will provide trace decode for current Arm Cortex cores and associated trace protocols.

We will provide a short presentation describing the library architecture and scope, along with use cases and outline examples. The current status of the project and future plans will also be provided. 
This will be followed a discussion / Q & A session.
