excerpt: "In this session, Tim Bird will discuss the mainline status of several Arm
  SoCs used in mobile products. The average phone uses kernel software that is 3 years
  old, 20 versions behind mainline, and has 1 to 3 million lines of code out-of-tree.
  Tim will describe the \u201CDevice Mainlining\u201D project of the Linux Foundation
  CE Workgroup, which seeks to address this problem. Some of the activities of this
  project are: \n* publishing tools for mainline analysis \n* finding big areas where
  multiple vendors have code out of tree \n* identifying institutional barriers to
  corporate developer mainlining, and addressing them through education, training,
  and collaboration \n* working with upstream to address deficient sub-systems or
  needed maintainer assistance\n\nIt is hoped that discussion will ensue about ways
  to continue enhancing this work, to get more SoC code mainlined."

SFO15-210: Kernel Mainline Status of Mobile Chipsets
Speaker:  Tim Bird
Date: September 22, 2015

★ Session Description ★
In this session, Tim Bird will discuss the mainline status of several Arm SoCs used in mobile products. The average phone uses kernel software that is 3 years old, 20 versions behind mainline, and has 1 to 3 million lines of code out-of-tree. Tim will describe the “Device Mainlining” project of the Linux foundation CE Workgroup, which seeks to address this problem. Some of the activities of this project are:
* publishing tools for mainline analysis
* finding big areas where multiple vendors have code out of tree
* identifying institutional barriers to corporate developer mainlining, and addressing them through education, training, and collaboration
* working with upstream to address deficient sub-systems or needed maintainer assistance
It is hoped that discussion will ensue about ways to continue enhancing this work, to get more SoC code mainlined.
