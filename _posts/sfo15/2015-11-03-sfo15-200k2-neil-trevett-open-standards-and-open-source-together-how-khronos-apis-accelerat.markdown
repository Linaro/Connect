★ Session Description ★
Discover how over 100 companies cooperate at the Khronos Group to create open, royalty free API standards to access hardware acceleration for heterogeneous parallel computation, 3D graphics and vision processing. Get the latest updates to API standards including OpenGL, OpenCL, OpenVX, and the recently announced Vulkan new generation graphics and compute API. Explore how cutting-edge APIs enable compelling experiences such as neural-net based driver assistance, virtual and augmented reality, and advanced 3D scene reconstruction on Arm-based devices. Finally, hear how Khronos is embracing and promoting multiple open source projects to boost the Arm developer ecosystem.
Short bio: Neil Trevett is Vice President of Mobile Ecosystems at NVIDIA where he works to enable mobile apps to make effective use of advanced silicon acceleration. Neil is also President of the Khronos Group that defines key acceleration APIs for the supercomputing, PC, mobile and embedded industries. At Khronos, Neil initiated the OpenGL ES 3D graphics API that now ships on over one billion phones a year, helped catalyze the development of WebGL that is shipping on all desktop and mobile browsers, and chairs the OpenCL working group for heterogeneous parallel computation.
