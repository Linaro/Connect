SFO15-407: Performance Overhead of ARM Virtualization
Speaker: Christoffer Dall
Date: September 24, 2015

★ Session Description ★
The ARM architecture’s support for virtualization has been designed for Type I hypervisors such as Xen. However, Type II hypervisors, such as KVM, offer increased convenience, portability, and an integrated software development environment with existing projects such as the Linux kernel and QEMU. Since the architecture has been designed with a separate CPU mode for the hypervisor, Type II hypervisors must perform the notorious “double-trap” to switch between the guest and the host, and many people have speculated that this causes KVM to be inherently slower than for example Xen. The truth is as always much more complicated than that, and it turns out that the differences in performance between Xen and KVM on the ARMv8 architecture come from entirely different sources. This talk will present a number of performance figures from running KVM and Xen on ARMv8 server hardware and will compare these numbers to x86 servers to illustrate the viability of virtualization on ARMv8 for the enterprise and networking markets.
