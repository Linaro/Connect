  RUNPATH), versioning structures, ELF sections on ARM/Aarch64, addressing models
  and performance considerations (PIC, short branches, long branches, relative addressing,
  trampolines, relaxation, etc), data alignment performance considerations on ARM/Aarch64,
  Timers, Timestamps and the VDSO, branch prediction extensions vs hardware auto branch
  prediction. Out-of-order execution vs in-order execution performance considerations,
