excerpt: Both the Field and more recently the LAVA lab have worked on HOWTOs to fill
  a need for a getting-up-and-running thread of documentation alongside the more mature
  reference information. Using material from both of these the session proposes to
  show how an evaluation installation of LAVA along with a qemu target can be assembled
  in a VM. The target audience is member engineers or managers who are aware of LAVA
  and would consider to evaluate a pilot local installation
