  meeting the security needs of OS vendors, SoC vendors, BIOS vendors and OEMs across
  all market segments. This informal session evaluates the current boot architecture(s)
  and immediate security needs of the Armv8-A ecosystem. This is an opportunity for
  all interested attendees to meet and set the agenda for more specific discussions
