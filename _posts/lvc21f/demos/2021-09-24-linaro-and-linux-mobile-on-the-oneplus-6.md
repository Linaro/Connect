Talking about how the upstream work by the Qualcomm landing team has helped to enable the Linux mobile community to work on modern devices, from feature enablement to reporting and fixing regressions.

For example the OnePlus 6 and PocoPhone F1 are both SDM845 powered devices with substantial hardware enablement on mainline, including support for mobile data and SMS support with ModemManager.

I'll be showing off various Linux-based distributions with varying levels of support on the OnePlus 6 (AOSP, postmarketOS, mobian, Arch linux ARM) which all make use of upstream kernels!
