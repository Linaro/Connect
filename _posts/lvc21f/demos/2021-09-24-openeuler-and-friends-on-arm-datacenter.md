Running an Arm/X86 Mixed cluster, depoly open source software stack including OS(openEuler), IAAS(K8S,Promethues,Ceph), DataBase(openGauss), BigData(Hadoop) and run a data processing task from resource creating, moniting to processing and quering.

This demo will provide a very good view of opensource software stack running on top of Arm Hardware, showing the growing software ecosystem. This demo will also illustrate how well Arm/x86 mixed cluster works in real life usecase.

A chinese version of this demo was performed live at openEuler 2020 Summit by 10 developers from different open source communities:
