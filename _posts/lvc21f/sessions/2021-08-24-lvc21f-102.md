  QuIC Inc.’s customers benefit from having all open-source code available in a downstream
  source release. As business is evolving, more of our customers need binaries and
  complete solutions that are easy to build and readily integrate into their products.We’ve
  partnered with Linaro to develop a set of services to enable a comprehensive downstream
  release environment to support our SOC ecosystem. We were looking to resolve challenges
  identified in the past with configuring and releasing our open-source software,
  and automating these processes wherever possible to provide a streamlined solution.
  CodeLinaro is a cloud-based platform enabling companies and communities to comprehensively
  manage the distribution of software to their customers and users. CodeLinaro integrates
  a set of key services into a complete software distribution platform, allowing us
  to easily integrate with our existing business processes. In this presentation we
  discuss challenges we have faced in our open-source release process and highlight
  the solutions we have co-created with CodeLinaro. We cover how we achieved a 10-year
  goal of aligning our release process across all software components for our SOC.
  Linaro will present an overview of CodeLinaro and how it can be used by any vendor
  in the SOC ecosystem.
