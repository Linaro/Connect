  QuIC Inc.’s customers benefit from having all open-source code available in a downstream
  source release. As business is evolving, more of our customers need binaries and
  complete solutions that are easy to build and readily integrate into their products.
  We’ve partnered with Linaro to develop a set of services to enable a comprehensive
  downstream release environment to support our SOC ecosystem. We were looking to
  resolve challenges identified in the past with configuring and releasing our open-source
  software, and automating these processes wherever possible to provide a streamlined
  solution. CodeLinaro is a cloud-based platform enabling companies and communities
  to comprehensively manage the distribution of software to their customers and users.
  CodeLinaro integrates a set of key services into a complete software distribution
  platform, allowing us to easily integrate with our existing business processes.
  In this presentation we discuss challenges we have faced in our open-source release
  process and highlight the solutions we have co-created with CodeLinaro. We cover
  how we achieved a 10-year goal of aligning our release process across all software
  components for our SOC. Linaro will present an overview of CodeLinaro and how it
  can be used by any vendor in the SOC ecosystem.
