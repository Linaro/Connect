description: 'Typically a DRM KMS driver will expose hardware blocks by registering

  objects: planes, crtcs, encoders corresponding to those blocks,

  allowing userspace to precisely select what it can do. In some cases

  it makes sense to register objects which are not directly mapped to

  hardware resources and let the driver select hardware resources

  backing these objects on its own.'

Typically a DRM KMS driver will expose hardware blocks by registering
objects: planes, crtcs, encoders corresponding to those blocks,
allowing userspace to precisely select what it can do. In some cases
it makes sense to register objects which are not directly mapped to
hardware resources and let the driver select hardware resources
backing these objects on its own.
