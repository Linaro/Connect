- speaker_bio: Gert Wollny studied mathematics at the University of Leipzig/Germany,
    and then joined the Max-Planck Institute of Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences
    in Leipzig to work in medical image analysis for which he received a Phd from
    the University of Leipzig in 2003. Doing that time he started to develop a toolbox
    for image processing that is available as free software. Later Gert Wollny joined
    the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology working of the analysis
    of fossil tooth micro CT data and then moved to the Politecnical University of
    Madrid/Spain where he continued his work in medical image analysis, here with
    a focus on cardiac imaging. After a career break he joined Collabora as a senior
    software developer and has been contributing to VirGL and Mesa3D since.

VirGL is a software-based approach to GFX virtualization that comes in two main pieces of software, on the host side virglrenderer, that interfaces with the host OpenGL and/or Vulkan driver, and in the guest Mesa3D provides either OpenGL (via virgl), or Vulkan (via Venus). VirGL offers an OpenGL virtualization that works on all host system that provide a working OpenGL driver. For example, the guest supports up to OpenGL 4.5 and up to OpenGL ES 3.2 if the host supports the according feature set. Similarly, Venus provides the Vulkan implementation based on the features the host Vulkan driver offers. Here, we will take a deep dive into how virglrenderer handles virtualization. discuss advantages and drawbacks of this purely software-based approach, and point out the similarities and differences between the OpenGL and Vulkan virtualizations. Looking ahead, we will also discuss how Zink, a Mesa3D driver providing OpenGL via Vulkan, could possibly help to improve the performance of the OpenGL virtualization by making use of Venus.
