  In this session I will demonstrate how one can build, boot and test a Linux tree
  with a single command, and how you can integrate that into your workflow. To do
  that locally, we will use TuxMake to build and its companion TuxRun to boot and
  test a local Linux tree against QEMU. TuxMake and TuxRun are free software projects
  created and maintained by Linaro, and can be chained together via TuxMake hooks
  to achieve the single command to build, boot and test a local Linux tree. For larger
  scale testing, you can do up to thousands of builds, boots and tests in parallel
  using TuxSuite. TuxSuite is a service by Linaro that runs TuxMake and TuxRun on
  the cloud for you, and can be a valuable piece of your QA process.
