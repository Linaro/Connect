description: "Level: Intermediate \n\n\n  \n\n\n\nApache Arrow is a software development
  platform for building high performance applications that process and transport large
  data sets. It is designed to both improve the performance of analytical algorithms
  and the efficiency of moving data from one system to another. Apache Arrow defines
  a language-independent columnar memory format for efficient analytic operations
  without serialization overhead. The contiguous columnar layout also enables vectorization
  using SIMD instructions in modern processors. We have been actively contributing
  to Apache Arrow for about two years. Our main focus is performance optimization
  in Arrow compute kernel, FlightRPC and Parquet modules. With our work, Arrow is
  seeing big performance boost, especially on Arm platforms. In this talk, we will:
  - Introduce Apache Arrow project and its ecosystem - Deep dive into Arrow columnar
  data format - Share our experience in Arrow performance optimization Through this
  talk, the audience will learn Apache Arrow essentials and how it pushes OLAP workloads
  performance to the extreme. And our software optimization practice may also be helpful
  to other projects.\n\n"
