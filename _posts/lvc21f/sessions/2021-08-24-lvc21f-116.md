description: 'Level: Introductory and overview 



  MCUboot is used as the secure boot loader for TF-M, and it recently had countermeasures
  added to make it more secure in the face of fault injection attacks. This talk will
  present the outcomes of a 6-months internship spent on assessing the effectiveness
  of those protections and will cover: - Overview of fault injection and how can be
  used to affect the behaviour of a system. - Introduce the MCUboot project and the
  software countermeasures against physical attacks. - Present the test setup and
  how the tests were performed. - Evaluate the effectiveness of the current protection
  schemes under different conditions (compiler options and protection levels). - Suggest
  improvements based on the evaluation results.

    obtain my master degree''s in electronics and computer science at Sorbonne University.

    During my internship, I''ve been working on assessing the effectiveness of MCUBoot
    protections against fault injection attacks. In my free time, I like to play the
    violin and play some video games.'

- speaker_bio: Arnaud started back in 1995 at VLSI Technology as a an ASIC design
    engineer. He then moved to a System Architect role, before focusing for about
    12 years on compilers, for custom architectures before joining Arm in 2014. He
    is now working in the Advanced Product Development group in the toolchain group,
    where he researches on tooling and solutions for improving the products' security,
    with a focus on physical attacks, e.g; fault injection and side channel.
