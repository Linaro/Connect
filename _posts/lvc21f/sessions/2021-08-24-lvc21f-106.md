  Sound Open Firmware is an open source audio DSP firmware and SDK that provides audio
  firmware infrastructure and development tools for developers who are interested
  in audio or signal processing on modern DSPs. On DSP side Sound Open Firmware is
  ported only on Xtensa architecture using XTOS support, thus making the firmware
  not available on platforms using other DSP architectures. This talk is about the
  work done on making Sound Open Firmware available as a module in Zephyr OS, thus
  making it available on all Zephyr supported architectures. The presentation will
  go into details about changes made to Sound Open Firmware platform to integrate
  Zephyr primitives, but also about Zephyr getting patches to support i.MX8 DSP integrations.
