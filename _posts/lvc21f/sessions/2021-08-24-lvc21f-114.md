  Hi everyone! On this session we will provide an overview of our efforts to leverage
  Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) by taking some of its parts into Trusted Execution
  Environment. These modifications designed to integrate LKRG into OS for mobile devices
  to enhance security and protect against zero-days. This session will provide a very
  short overview of ARM TrustZone with program components rely on it, and then we
  will dive into LKRG internal environment and its restrictions. After that, we will
  present our approach to bring several parts of LKRG to Open Portable TEE (OP-TEE)
  with TF-A assistance.
