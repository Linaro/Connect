  The Arm SystemReady certification program defines standards for hardware and firmware
  to enable operating systems to just work. A new specification, the Base Boot Security
  Requirements (BBSR) specification, extends standardization of firmware interfaces
  to security. BBSR defines standards for UEFI Secure Boot, firmware update via capsules,
  and TPMs to enable operating systems to work with them seamlessly. This session
  presents an overview of BBSR, introduces compliance tests being developed, and describes
  how compliance to BBSR will relate to the Platform Security Architecture (PSA).
