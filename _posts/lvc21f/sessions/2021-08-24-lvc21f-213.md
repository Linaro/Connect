description: "level: Intermediate \nTinyML aka Tiny Machine Learning has been proven
  as a revolution for this gigantic world. With the help of this technology, you can
  now run ML tasks on small and cheap devices consuming under 1mW. The support from
  Google's TensorFlow Lite Micro Team, Arm, Arduino even from startups such as Edge
  Impulse has been proven efficient to run ML, Computer Vision and Deep Learning tasks
  on these boards. In this session, I would share brighter info on what's TinyML and
  why, and how this is truly a revolution!"
