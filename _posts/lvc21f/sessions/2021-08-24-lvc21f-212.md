description: "Level: Intermediate This session introduces development of oneDNN
  for Armv8-A + SVE architecture. oneDNN is one of the de facto deep learning processing
  library, which is originally developed for Intel architecture. oneDNN optimizes
  the execution code by writing at the x86_64 instruction level with the Just-In-Time

  the x86_64 instruction-level code into that of AArch64 instruction-level with
  the Just-In-Time assembler for AArch64, Xbyak_aarch64. It is very time-consuming
  work. To eliminate this work, we developed the binary translator Xbyak_translator_aarch64

Level: Intermediate
This session introduces development of oneDNN for Armv8-A + SVE architecture. oneDNN is one of the de facto deep learning processing library, which is originally developed for Intel architecture. oneDNN optimizes the execution code by writing at the x86_64 instruction level with the Just-In-Time assembler "Xbyak". The porting work of oneDNN for AArch64 requires to rewrite the x86_64 instruction-level code into that of AArch64 instruction-level with the Just-In-Time assembler for AArch64, "Xbyak_aarch64". It is very time-consuming work. To eliminate this work, we developed the binary translator "Xbyak_translator_aarch64" which is also introduced in this session.
