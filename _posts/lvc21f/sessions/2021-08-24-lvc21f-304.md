title: LVC21F-304 ACPI overlays for embedded devices
---

Level: Intermediate 
ACPI SSDT overlays is quite useful for embedded devices when one may change device configuration at runtime, while being advertised as a debug mechanism in such case. The goal is to show how to create an overlay for most used peripheral (usually I²C or SPI connected) and manage it at runtime.
