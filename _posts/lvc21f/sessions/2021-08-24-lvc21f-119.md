  In the embedded multimedia world, it is often a challenge to orchestrate multimedia
  streams in such a way so that the final product is robust, consistent and secure.
  In many cases, such systems end up doing all their multimedia in a single custom
  GStreamer pipeline or they develop complex orchestration systems around desktop-oriented
  solutions, circumventing desktop behaviour. PipeWire is a simple but powerful multimedia
  IPC framework that can be used to implement any kind of multimedia routing service,
  like an audio server (ex. PulseAudio, JACK) or a video capture portal. WirePlumber
  is a modular and scriptable session manager (i.e. orchestrator) for PipeWire. In
  this presentation, George will walk you through an interactive demo showing how
  easy it is to implement a custom, powerful and secure audio/video stream routing
  service using PipeWire, WirePlumber and rules scripted in Lua.
