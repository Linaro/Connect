- speaker_bio: 'Krunal has been actively working in the MySQL space as a contributor
    and committer for over a decade now. He is currently driving the #dbonarm initiative.
    As part of this initiative, he continues to work closely with MySQL, MariaDB,
    Percona, PostgreSQL community to make respective ecosystems available on ARM in
    optimal fashion by contributing high-impact performance patches. His recent efforts
    have already helped scale these databases with a significant margin making their
    ARM offering competitive.


    In past, he has worked on multiple MySQL projects viz. undo log truncate, atomic
    truncate, temp table work (switching from mysql to innodb), Percona XtraDB Cluster
    performance, leading the PXC-5.7/8.0 product, etc.. as part of his tenure at MySQL/Oracle
    (as InnoDB developer) and Percona (as PXC product lead). Prior to MySQL, he has
    worked extensively on other data-management projects including big-data research,
    network event data management, building the fastest storage engine for MySQL,
    ETL tool data-processing, etc...'

title: LVC21F-219 Tips and Tricks to tune your software for ARM

Level: Intermediate 
MySQL as the ecosystem has adapted ARM for quite some time and lately, production-ready cloud services based on ARM have gained quite a good traction.

So how did one of the complex ecosystems of databases tuned itself for a completely new environment? Let's explore some quick tips and tricks based on real-life learning that would act as a good starting point for all users who plan to port their software to ARM. Also, let's touch base ongoing issues, and maybe there are common challenges, opening up an opportunity for cross-community idea exchange.
