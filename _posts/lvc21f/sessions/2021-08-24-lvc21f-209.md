  Firmware Framework - M (FF-M) v1.1 introduces a new interrupt handling model - the
  First-Level Interrupt Handling (FLIH) - which supports handling interrupts within
  a bounded response time. Trusted Firmware - M (TF-M), as a reference implementation
  of FF-M, has implemented the FLIH model. The FLIH could be privileged or deprivileged
  depends on the isolation requirements. A deprivileged FLIH requires an exception
  return to unprivileged Thread Mode which has the lowest exception priority thus
  makes the interrupt handling preemptable by lower priority exceptions. This session
  introduces how TF-M implements the FLIH, including how to solve the priority issue
  in deprivileged FLIH.
