  have set up a software-defined storage project, working to eliminate the gap. We
  are co-working with our members and open-source upstream such as Ceph, Rook, Lustre,
  Mayastor etc to enable, validate and set up CI on Arm64. Besides, we’ve maintained
  an Ecosystem Landscape for storage on Arm64, which shows all the storage and accelerator
  project development/CI/optimization status on Arm64.\n\nIn this presentation, we
  will cover all the efforts we’ve done to enable and fix the issues for Ceph, Rook
  CI on Arm64. Besides, we will elaborate on the current status of some storage projects
  such as Lustre, Longhorn and Mayastor, and share the ecosystem landscape of storage
  on Arm64."

Level: Intermediate 
Nowadays, when we are talking about the Arm64 enterprise market, more and more interest has been put on open-source storage systems. The advantage of multiple-cores computing in parallel and high-performance I/O makes Arm64 have the capability to extend the storage usage scenario. However, compared with other architectures, Arm64 still has a long way to go, which is not only storage ecosystem enablement/CI setup but also performance optimization.

At Linaro, we have set up a software-defined storage project, working to eliminate the gap. We are co-working with our members and open-source upstream such as Ceph, Rook, Lustre, Mayastor etc to enable, validate and set up CI on Arm64. Besides, we’ve maintained an Ecosystem Landscape for storage on Arm64, which shows all the storage and accelerator project development/CI/optimization status on Arm64.

In this presentation, we will cover all the efforts we’ve done to enable and fix the issues for Ceph, Rook CI on Arm64. Besides, we will elaborate on the current status of some storage projects such as Lustre, Longhorn and Mayastor, and share the ecosystem landscape of storage on Arm64.
