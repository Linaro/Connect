description: 'Level: Introductory and Overview 



  Apache Bigtop provides full functionality of packaging, testing, and configuration
  of the leading open source Bigdata components for users to build their own Arm64
  Bigdata Distros from ground up. Bigtop 3.0, the first release based on Hadoop 3,
  supported Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora are also
  updated. The new upgraded Mpack integrated in Bigotp 3.0 is aligned with Ambari
  2.7.5 which makes Bigdata deployment and management simpler and more flexible with
  a click of button. This introductory session will provide the overview of new Bigtop
  3.0. The speaker will give an in-depth perspective into the new upgraded Arm64 Mpacks
  architecture and he also will talk about the lessons learned so far like migrating
  compatibility issues and dependency conflicts in the ecosystem.
