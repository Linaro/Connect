  of a standard interface that can discover and configure computer hardware components
  as well as perform power management. \n\nIn this talk, we will introduce our work
  of supporting ACPI and UEFI in Cloud Hypervisor on Arm64, including the design of
  Cloud Hypervisor Arm64 memory layout, AML code generation, and the Cloud Hypervisor
  support in the EDK2 family. There will also be a short demo to show a simple Ubuntu
  20.04 LTS (cloudimg) guest booted using ACPI+UEFI. It is hoped that the work we
  show in this talk will pave the road to the full Arm64 hotplug support in future."

Level: Advanced 
Cloud Hypervisor is an open-source virtual machine monitor for modern cloud workloads. It is written in Rust with a strong focus on security and a minimal compact footprint. 

Recent trends in modern cloud workloads have seen a growing interest towards specific features of VMM such as CPU, memory and device hotplug, and one of the key issues to satisfy that interest is the implementation of a standard interface that can discover and configure computer hardware components as well as perform power management. 

In this talk, we will introduce our work of supporting ACPI and UEFI in Cloud Hypervisor on Arm64, including the design of Cloud Hypervisor Arm64 memory layout, AML code generation, and the Cloud Hypervisor support in the EDK2 family. There will also be a short demo to show a simple Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (cloudimg) guest booted using ACPI+UEFI. It is hoped that the work we show in this talk will pave the road to the full Arm64 hotplug support in future.
