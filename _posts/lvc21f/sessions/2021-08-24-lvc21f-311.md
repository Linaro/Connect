description: "Level: Intermediate \nThis talk aims to introduce the firmware architecture
  for Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (Arm CCA) involving the 2 firmware components:
  Realm management Monitor and the Monitor (Trusted Firmware-A). Arm CCA introduces
  the Realm world which is isolated from both Secure and Non Secure worlds. “Realms”
  are dynamically created by the Hypervisor and this is achieved via the Realm management
  Interface (RMI) interacting with the RMM.\n\nTrusted Firmware – A (TF-A) is the
  reference monitor firmware implementation and is responsible for booting the Trusted
  Compute Base (TCB) and enforcing isolation between the Non Secure, Secure and Realm
  worlds. The talk will give an overview of the implementation in TF-A for Arm CCA
  and will cover topics like :\n\n* Boot flow in Arm CCA systems\n* 4 world management\n*
  Interaction with Secure world\n* Implications for Secure Partition Manager (SPM)
  due to introduction of Arm CCA."

title: LVC21F-311 Overview of Firmware Architecture for Arm CCA
---

Level: Intermediate 
This talk aims to introduce the firmware architecture for Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (Arm CCA) involving the 2 firmware components: Realm management Monitor and the Monitor (Trusted Firmware-A). Arm CCA introduces the Realm world which is isolated from both Secure and Non Secure worlds. “Realms” are dynamically created by the Hypervisor and this is achieved via the Realm management Interface (RMI) interacting with the RMM.

Trusted Firmware – A (TF-A) is the reference monitor firmware implementation and is responsible for booting the Trusted Compute Base (TCB) and enforcing isolation between the Non Secure, Secure and Realm worlds. The talk will give an overview of the implementation in TF-A for Arm CCA and will cover topics like :

* Boot flow in Arm CCA systems
* 4 world management
* Interaction with Secure world
* Implications for Secure Partition Manager (SPM) due to introduction of Arm CCA.
