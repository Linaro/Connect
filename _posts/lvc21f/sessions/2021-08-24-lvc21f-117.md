  The Secure Partition Manager (SPM) for Arm Cortex-A is a firmware component residing
  in the secure side of TrustZone (at the Secure EL2 exception level). Its intent
  is to isolate mutually mistrusting secure partitions and help SW components defragmentation.
  It relies on Arm''s Firmware Framework for Cortex-A specification as a foundation
  for the protocol and memory sharing operations. It is developed as an open source
  project in trustedfirmware.org with regular updates following the Trusted Firmware-A''s
  release cadence. In this follow up session, we present the development status of
  the SPM with this agenda: -A brief on the recently added SPM features and roadmap.
  -Planned features from the newly released FF-A v1.1 specification. -Recent improvement
  to the Hafnium CI. -Introduction of S-EL0 partitions and proposed technical solutions.
  -A brief on Arm CCA impact to the SPM.
