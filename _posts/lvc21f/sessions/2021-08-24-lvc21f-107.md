  Reaching higher IOPS becomes increasingly important as drive capacities grow. Multi-actuator
  drives are an effective response to this need. They appear as a single device to
  the I/O subsystem. Yet they address commands to different actuators internally,
  as a function of LBAs. This poses the following important challenge: information
  on the destination actuator of each command must be used cleverly by the I/O subsystem.
  Otherwise the system has little or no control over the load balance among actuators;
  some actuators may be underutilized or remain totally idle. I/O schedulers are the
  best candidates for tackling this problem, as their role is exactly to decide the
  order in which to dispatch commands. In consultation with Seagate Technology, we
  have enriched the BFQ I/O scheduler with extra logics for multiple actuators. Exploiting
  knowledge of the destination actuators of commands, this extended version of BFQ
  provides dramatic performance improvements, over a wide range of workloads. At the
  same time, it preserves the original bandwidth and latency guarantees of BFQ. As
  a more general contribution, the concepts and strategies used in BFQ show effective
  ways to take advantage of the IOPS gains of multi-actuator drives.

- speaker_bio: Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
    University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and a collaborator of the Linaro
    engineering organization. Paolo's main activities focus on scheduling algorithms
    for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs. In this respect, Paolo is the
    author of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler. BFQ entered the Linux kernel
    from 4.12, providing unprecedented low-latency and fairness guarantees. As for
    transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which
    has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+,
    a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Finally, Paolo has
    also defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD,
    and has provided new theoretic results on multiprocessor scheduling.
