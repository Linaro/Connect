  The UCSD Coordinated Robotics Lab, in collaboration with the Contextual Robotics
  Institute at UC San Diego and Qualcomm, is developing an ecosystem of ARM-based
  control boards (in the Raspberry Pi, 96boards, and BeagleBone formats) for embedded
  applications in mobile robotics and cyber-physical systems. These boards, dubbed
  Berets, are compact, powerful, efficient, and easily extended. Their primary functions
  are power regulation (from 2S to 6S LiPos at up to 20A) and advanced feedback control,
  for both brushed and brushless motors in a wide variety of sizes. The software that
  drives this new family of boards will facilitate easy portability from one SBC platform
  to another; ROS drivers are also under development.

- speaker_bio: Ricardo Gorinstein is a Ph.D. student at the University of California
    San Diego, studying advanced dynamics and control of small robotics systems. He
    has been developing the Beret family of boards for two years along with a new
    design of the educational balancing robot, EduMiP, which is used to teach senior-
    and graduate-level control classes.

- speaker_bio: Prof Thomas R Bewley (BS/MS, Caltech, 1989; diploma, von Karman Institute
    for Fluid Dynamics, 1990; PhD, Stanford, 1998) directs the UCSD Flow Control and
    Coordinated Robotics Labs. The Flow Control Lab investigates a host of questions
    ranging from theoretical to applied, including the development of advanced analysis
    tools and numerical methods to better understand, optimize, estimate, forecast,
    and control fluid systems. The Coordinated Robotics Lab investigates the mobility
    and coordination of small multi-modal robotic vehicles, leveraging dynamic models
    and feedback control, with prototypes built using cellphone-grade electronics,
    custom PCBs, and 3D printing; the team has also worked with a number of commercial
    partners to design and bring successful consumer and educational-focused robotics
    products to market. The two labs collaborate closely on a variety of interdisciplinary
    projects, including the coordination of tethered balloons near cliffs, untethered
    balloons in hurricanes, and the adaptive deployment of sensor vehicles in environmental
    plumes.
