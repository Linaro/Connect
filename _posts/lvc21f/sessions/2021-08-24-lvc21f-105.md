  Compliance with copyright can be a nightmare, especially if the project faces it
  late in development. Everybody is now figuring out how to use tools and how this
  could help. We have been tasked with ensuring compliance of an **entire operating
  system**, something that would take months/man if not years. The gold standard is
  today to integrate compliance in CI/CD. We present our solutions, particularly directed
  at Yocto/Bitbake projects.
