  Smaller computing systems have special needs from the development environment. Limited
  space and limited processing capability mean that the tooling needs to offer a range
  of functionality that can be tailored to the target system while allowing mechanisms
  for leaving unnecessary functionality out of the environment entirely. One area
  that, surprisingly, hasn''t seen much work in the free software world is the C runtime
  library for 32- and 64- bit microcontrollers. There are numerous C libraries designed
  for 8-bit systems, such as Atmel''s ATmega series, but ARM embedded systems haven''t
  had a project designed just for them. Picolibc hopes to fill this nitch; targeting
  bare-metal and RTOS systems for 32- and 64- bit processors. This presentation will
  describe a couple of key advancements in Picolibc over the last year, including
  the development of a new algorithm for floating point printf/scanf which offers
  precise results without requiring an allocator (unique in C libraries), testing
  infrastructure which validates the code in hundreds of configurations. Finally,
  I''ll discuss experiences in adding support for Picolibc to numerous free software
  projects, including Zephyr, Crosstool-NG, FreeRTOS, GCC and RIOT.
