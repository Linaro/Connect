Level: Advanced 
Display interface solutions are often critical to design due a mismatch between System On Chips(SoC) and it’s associated application-specific display devices. 

A display interface bridge prevents this mismatch by converting application-specific display interfaces from SoC display controllers. The type of display interface bridge depends on the display interface bus used between SoC display controller and application-specific displays.

Most of the modern Embedded SoC's and application displays are choosing MIPI DSI as a standard display interface bridge due to its interface advantages, lack of long-term availability of discrete MIPI DSI panels, 

So, what are these MIPI DSI bridges? How are these used in SoC display controllers? How are these used in application displays? This talk will address all these information by considering
real-time solutions from NXP i.MX8MM, Allwinner R16, and TI DLP Projectors. 

After that, this talk explains how to incorporate new MIPI DSI Host, Bridges, Panels drivers/API's into Linux DRM Subsystem by converting MIPI DSI to RGB/LVDS/HDMI and vice-versa.
