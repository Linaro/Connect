Level: Introductory and overview

Data centers are becoming increasingly heterogeneous. Data Center operators are increasingly building their own hardware. And yet there are so many server functions in the data center that are common across Data Center operators.

This discussion will focus on areas of server management, testing, and security and how the community can commonly invest to increase the efficiency of building and maintaining these fleets.
