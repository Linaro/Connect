  Nowadays MCUs are widely used in applications including IoT, network system, industrial
  and medical systems. Although many of these applications can be implemented using
  integer arithmetic, there are still high demand of ability to process with floating
  point numbers, especially for the calculation of signal processing, artificial intelligence.
  Calculations for floating-point numbers can be accelerated by using a Floating-point
  unit (FPU) integrated in the processor. This topic focuses on floating point support
  in Trusted Firmware M as following. How to enable floating point support in Trusted
  Firmware M. Guidelines of system configuration for security purpose. Approaches
  about secure floating-point context protection for scenarios of enabled/disabled
  automatic lazy context save. Security analysis about how to avoid secure floating-point
  information leakage and how to avoid non-secure floating-point data being impacted.
  Also address some points should be noticed when enable floating-point in secure
  side only, non-secure side only or both sides. The main audience takeaways will
  be general understanding of how to enable floating point support and how to protect
  secure floating point context in system with secure firmware inside.
