description: "Level: Introductory and Overview \nWith more and more developers working
  on Arm related works the ecosystem for software around Arm data center has grown
  very fast in the past two years. But we have some observation that made the contributions
  not that efficient during our work, the most important thing is lack of communication
  and co-operation, contributors from different organizations does not know much about
  what others are currently doing when contributing Arm related stuff to the upstream
  communities as there are too many communities and quite distributed. \n\nIn order
  to solve this problem, we started a little project that is aimed to provide a centralized
  information hub for all Arm developers in the world, the project will include a
  landscape - providing information about all the open source that can support Arm
  and what is going on if it is work in progress, it will also include a detailed
  page to show detailed informations about the project like the upstream Arm CI status,
  versions that supported Arm hardware, user stories, etc. The project will also include
  a series of communcation means, like slack, IRC etc.\n\nBy providing a centralized
  information hub, the Arm developers can have a very good place to communicate and
  knowing what others are doing, and can improve the efficiency a lot."

Level: Introductory and Overview 
With more and more developers working on Arm related works the ecosystem for software around Arm data center has grown very fast in the past two years. But we have some observation that made the contributions not that efficient during our work, the most important thing is lack of communication and co-operation, contributors from different organizations does not know much about what others are currently doing when contributing Arm related stuff to the upstream communities as there are too many communities and quite distributed. 

In order to solve this problem, we started a little project that is aimed to provide a centralized information hub for all Arm developers in the world, the project will include a landscape - providing information about all the open source that can support Arm and what is going on if it is work in progress, it will also include a detailed page to show detailed informations about the project like the upstream Arm CI status, versions that supported Arm hardware, user stories, etc. The project will also include a series of communcation means, like slack, IRC etc.

By providing a centralized information hub, the Arm developers can have a very good place to communicate and knowing what others are doing, and can improve the efficiency a lot.
