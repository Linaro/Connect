- speaker_bio: I graduated from the Bauman Moscow State Technical University in 2009,
    majoring in information security. I have worked in software development for over
    15 years, primarily focusing on server-side network software and embedded systems.
    Three years ago, I joined Arm, specifically, the Arm Compiler team, where I was
    involved in developing C and C++ standard libraries, Arm and AArch64 LLVM backends.
    More recently, I have been working on the new LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm.

title: LVC21F-321 The LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm, a new open source toolchain
---

Level: Intermediate 
For many years the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain has provided an open-source toolchain targeting embedded systems. The LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm is a new open-source project with the goal of providing an LLVM based equivalent to the GNU Embedded toolchain. We would like the LLVM Embedded Toolchain to lower the bar to entry of using LLVM in Embedded systems. Initially targeting M profile systems with a special focus on v8.1-M.

The presentation will contain a description of:
* Why do we need an LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm?
* The challenges of targeting embedded systems with LLVM components and how the LLVM Embedded Toolchain addresses them.
* A comparison between the LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm and the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain.
* Future plans.
