Level: Introductory and overview 
Futureproof and flexible electric and electronic architectures are a top priority for all automotive OEMs.

Today vehicles already belong to the broad IoT world but in future, they will need to seamlessly and efficiently interact, and share data, with a much more complex ecosystem, including domains like manufacturers´ back-end, public-cloud, connectivity infrastructure and the “smart world”.

Software and Centralized hardware are two essential enablers, opening the mobility ecosystem to new and expanding business opportunities.
