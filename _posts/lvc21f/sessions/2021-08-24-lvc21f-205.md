Level: Advanced 
Nowadays with the reduction of the price and the increase of the capability for the flash devices, the all-flash solution in the distributed storage area has attracted a lot of interest. In this presentation, we will talk about the optimization of Ceph all-flash solution on Arm64, we will elaborate some details as below:
Avoid cross-NUMA data access
CPU partition optimization thread resource scheduling
Boost performance with 64K PageSize
Software prefetching reduces cache miss.
