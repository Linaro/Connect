  Today''s connected device fleets are getting larger and the ability to monitor individual
  devices within a fleet is required for troubleshooting, optimization, and general
  fleet maintenance. With the ubiquity of network connectivity, we can set up fleet
  monitoring using a cloud-based solution, allowing for a single dashboard to view
  and monitor your fleet. In this talk, we will present a general overview of fleet
  monitoring architectures as well as several software packages that can be used to
  implement them. We will compare and contrast several options for both the client-side
  and the server-side software. We will also prepare a reference implementation using
  Yocto that can be implemented in custom builds, paired with a cloud-based fleet
  monitoring web interface.
