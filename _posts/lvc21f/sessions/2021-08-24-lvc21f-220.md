- speaker_bio: 'Krunal has been actively working in the MySQL space as a contributor
    and committer for over a decade now. He is currently driving the #dbonarm initiative.
    As part of this initiative, he continues to work closely with MySQL, MariaDB,
    Percona, PostgreSQL community to make respective ecosystems available on ARM in
    optimal fashion by contributing high-impact performance patches. His recent efforts
    have already helped scale these databases with a significant margin making their
    ARM offering competitive.


    In past, he has worked on multiple MySQL projects viz. undo log truncate, atomic
    truncate, temp table work (switching from mysql to innodb), Percona XtraDB Cluster
    performance, leading the PXC-5.7/8.0 product, etc.. as part of his tenure at MySQL/Oracle
    (as InnoDB developer) and Percona (as PXC product lead). Prior to MySQL, he has
    worked extensively on other data-management projects including big-data research,
    network event data management, building the fastest storage engine for MySQL,
    ETL tool data-processing, etc...'

title: LVC21F-220 Opensource Database Ecosystem on ARM
---

Level: Introductory and Overview 
In recent years, ARM has gained a lot of traction for running open-source databases. Most of the popular open-source databases now officially support ARM and with community contributions, the performance of these databases on ARM is continuously improving. Also, the supporting tools/ecosystem is moving to ARM with the majority of the tools already ported or community-evaluated.

Let's try exploring what is state of different database ecosystems, look at some performance numbers, upcoming challenges, etc... and set up a discussion between ARM and the DB community to help solve these challenges.
