title: LVC21F-315 YAML as a new Device Tree source format
---

Level: Intermediate 
System Device Tree is an ongoing effort to expand the scope of Device Tree to describe and configure modern heterogeneous SoCs, including multiple CPUs clusters, and the software running on them. As part of this effort, we realized that we would benefit from a more intuitive source format for the software configuration portion of System Device Tree, which is meant to be editable by system software architects.

To address this need, we introduced a YAML-based source format, simplified but equivalent to Device Tree source. It is more intuitive and easier to write compared to the native Device Tree source format. This talk will go into detail about the new YAML format, it will discuss its merits, and whether it makes sense not just for a subset of System Device Tree but for Device Tree as a whole.
