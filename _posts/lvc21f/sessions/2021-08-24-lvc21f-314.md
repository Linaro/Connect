description: "Level: Advanced \nThe Arm Server Base Manageability Requirements (SBMR)
  Specification defines standard firmware and hardware management interfaces for Arm
  servers. The SBMR \"side-band\" interface is used for communicating power sensors,
  telemetry data, and RAS and other events from the Arm server CPUs to the BMC. The
  data is then made available to remote management software through interfaces such
  as Redfish and IPMI. In this presentation, we will highlight the design and requirements
  of the Arm servers side-band management interface. We will also showcase proof-of-concept
  porotype of the interface using the OpenBMC firmware and Zephyr open source projects
  running on ASPEED AST2600 evaluation kit and Arduino Due microcontroller board.
  Finally, we will present upstreaming and enabling activity around this prototype."
