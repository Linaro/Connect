description: "Level: Expert \nLinux is dominated by big distro vendor names, who tell
  us that in order to build a product, you need a vertically integrated full-stack
  distribution. Distros have been the cornerstones of Linux for the past two decades,
  but now with the advances made in cloud technology and infrastructure, they have
  become less relevant and may only be significant at the application level. Is embedded
  linux going in the same direction? What if an OS could be done away with altogether?
  The Linux kernel will then become the framework for an embedded system made up of
  a set of modular functions with independent lifecycle management without a branded
  OS. In this talk, we’ll discuss how containerization has revolutionized the distro
  and how containers allow for efficient and portable OS updates on your existing
  distro."

Level: Expert 
Linux is dominated by big distro vendor names, who tell us that in order to build a product, you need a vertically integrated full-stack distribution. Distros have been the cornerstones of Linux for the past two decades, but now with the advances made in cloud technology and infrastructure, they have become less relevant and may only be significant at the application level. Is embedded linux going in the same direction? What if an OS could be done away with altogether? The Linux kernel will then become the framework for an embedded system made up of a set of modular functions with independent lifecycle management without a branded OS. In this talk, we’ll discuss how containerization has revolutionized the distro and how containers allow for efficient and portable OS updates on your existing distro.
