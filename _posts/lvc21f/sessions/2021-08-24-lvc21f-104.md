description: 'Level: Introductory and overview 



  Long term growth and innovation are key fundamental factors into open source projects,
  and they come along with organizations being competitive on the market. How the
  right CI/CD strategy will keep all that up? which are the devops challenges to be
  faced for a comprehensive CI/CD and testing strategy? That''s where remote labs
  come in by introducing a concept which provides partners with the unique ability
  to integrate the device testing directly into the development process upstream in
  a streamlined process via LAVA software stack. That''s how OpenHarmony works to
  guarantee 360° smoothness, making it as simple as connecting the device to a host
  (at your home or office) and installing a few packages via apt. Everything else
  is completely automated, from creating a merge request upstream to getting the test
  results into the GitLab and validating the patch for test errors. A full end-to-end
  journey into testing monitored overview.

- speaker_bio: I'm a LAVA testing expert and I'm currently leading the testing and
    CI automation effort for the OpenHarmony project. You can consider me a jack of
    all trades though as I've been contributing a little bit to a lot of projects
    from the beginning of Linaro.
