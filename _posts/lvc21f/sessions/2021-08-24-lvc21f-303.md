title: LVC21F-303 Secure Sensor Data Pipeline
---

Level: Introductory and overview
Presentation of an initial proof of concept of an extensible sensor data processing pipeline, capable of running in secure or non-secure processing environments.

Sensor data is potentially sensitive, and may need to be secured on and off device. There are often requiremeents to process, sanitise, hash, sign and/or encrypt it as it moves through various systems, which is often done in an ad-hoc manner.

This talk proposes a proof of concept to precisely describe nearly any sort of small sensor data in standard SI units and scales, as well as a mechanism to process that data in a flexible, easily extensible manner, with several best-practice building blocks provided out of the box.
