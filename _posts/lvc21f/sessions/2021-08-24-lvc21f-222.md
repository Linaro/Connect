Level: Advanced 
Historically, the modem firmware used to be a black box to the end users. Modems typically expose AT or a vendor specific protocol over the communication interfaces and kept their binary form over time. But due to the increasing number of vulnerabilities being discovered, it became evident that the modems too need to run the latest and greatest software stack to protect themselves from various mitigable attacks.

At Linaro, we recently started working on upstreaming the Linux kernel support for Qualcomm modems, in specific SDX55 a.k.a. Snapdragon X55 5G Modems. Our goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end upstream solution on Qualcomm based host and modem platforms with 4G/5G data connectivity.

This talk will present an overall picture of Qualcomm modem's software stack and walk through the upstreaming process by taking SDX55 as the case study.
