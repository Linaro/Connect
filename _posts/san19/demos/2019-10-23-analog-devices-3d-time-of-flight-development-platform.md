Demonstration of Analog Devices AD-96TOF1-EBZ development kit demonstrating 3D depth mapping.3D depth mapping is useful for many applications ranging from Gesture Control, Surveillance, Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM), People Counting, Collision Avoidance, Computer Depth Perception, and Safety/Proximity Sensing. The two (2) board mezzanine system with laser drive and camera connect to a DragaonBoard 410c processor baseboard to generate point cloud depth images.
