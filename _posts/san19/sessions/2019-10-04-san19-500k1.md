description: Over the last 10+ years, we have been developing the Coccinelle C-program
  matching and transformation tool. Coccinelle allows developers to match and transform
  C code via a generalization of the familiar patch syntax. As Coccinelle is independent
  of the C preprocessor, Coccinelle rules can be applied across a code base, regardless
  of configuration constraints. Over the years, Coccinelle has been extensively used
  in Linux kernel development, resulting in over 7000 commits to the Linux kernel,
  and has found its place as part of the Linux kernel development process. This talk
  gives an introduction to the use of Coccinelle and gives an overview of its impact
  on the Linux kernel.
