description: The System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is a set of operating
  system-independent software interfaces that are used in system resources management
  that has been originally specified to standardize the interface between Application
  Processors and the power coprocessor. Nevertheless, systems dont always have a dedicated
  coprocessor for system resources management but still need to safely manage them.The
  secure world is a good candidate as it uses some of these critical resources. Instead
  of defining a new custom interface, it has been decided to enable a SCMI server
  in secure world that will handle system request from all agents of the system being
  the non secure world of AP or other processors of the system.<br /> This talk will
  present the SCMI server implementation in secure world, the constraints that have
  driven the implementation choices, the open items and next features. During the
  talk, we will have a special focus on the OP-TEE arm32 implementation.
