description: There are several mobile and server AI benchmarks in use today and some
  new ones on the horizon. Which of these or others are applicable to IoT use cases?
  How do you meaningfully compare AI performance across the wide range of IoT HW with
  widely varying cost, memory, power and thermal constraints, and accuracy tradeoffs
  for quantized models vs non-quantized models? This talk will discuss these topics
  and some of the possible ways to address the issues.
