description: Continuing from Linaro Connect BKK19, where the Arm SCMI Roadmap was
  unveiled, we have released SCMI specification version 2.0 in July/August 2019. This
  version of the specification enables new usage models to cater to Power Management
  and System Control requirements in Mobile, Embedded and Automotive markets. <br
  /> <br /> Cost sensitive SoC designs may not opt for a stand-alone microcontroller
  for System Control. For such systems, SCMIv2.0 enables the System Control Firmware
  to be resident in the secure world. We shall go over the requirements to implement
  the kernel and firmware code for such systems to comply with SCMI.<br /> <br />
  SCMIv2.0 introduces the concept of Per-Agent Resource Isolation Domains. Many SoCs
  today implement multiple PE Clusters where each cluster runs a different OS instance.
  Such systems require the SoC resources to be partitioned dynamically among the various
  agents (we may model each such cluster to be a SCMI agent). SCMIv2.0 introduces
  new commands to achieve this. In our session, we shall talk about how this can be
  done using the new SCMIv2.0 commands, and the agent-id and transport requirements
  and semantics for such a model to work. We will also provide an overview how such
  a model might work for Virtualized Systems. The presentation will cover how newly
  introduced Power Domain pre-notifications can be used for co-operative Power Management
  according to user defined policies in such systems. <br /> <br /> SCMIv2.0 introduces
  FastChannels. We will provide an overview of its requirements and how FastChannels
  can be enabled for latency critical operations. We will also touch upon the Reset
  Management Protocol which can be used for device resets. Finally we will walk-through
  the features planned to be introduced in the next version of SCMI.<br />
