description: <strong>Securing the Billions of Devices Around Us - – Ed Nightingale,
  Partner Director of Engineering, Microsoft Azure Sphere</strong><br>The next decade
  promises the democratization of connectivity to every device. Significant drops
  in the cost of connectivity mean that every form of electrical device—every child’s
  toy, every household’s appliances, and every sensor—will become connected to the
  Internet. Tens of billions of these devices are controlled by microcontrollers,
  a class of device particularly ill-prepared for the security challenges of internet
  connectivity. &nbsp;What is required to secure these billions of devices? &nbsp;Microsoft
  defines 7 properties that define the minimum standard for&nbsp;<u>any</u> device
  connecting to the internet and in this talk we’ll dive into each as we make the
  case for a better standard for security and connectivity.
