description: In the weeks leading up to ArmTechCon 2018, and then at the event, Drew
  Henry outlined his vision of a trillion connected devices. Those trillion connected
  devices will need a significant rethinking of how infrastructure is built and delivered,
  and the Arm Neoverse initiative was created to address those challenges.<br /> <br
  /> The past 6 months have seen much written on the topic of bringing workloads back
  from the Cloud, and moving them to the Edge, closer to the end users or to IoT endpoints,
  and improving the service delivery experience. While there have been many articles,
  slides, headlines, and conversations about this, no one has yet to demonstrate a
  full end-to-end working Arm-based implementation. miniNodes is building a complete
  demonstration of connected Cloud Servers, Edge Servers, and IoT Devices, running
  entirely on Arm. Environmental data will be captured by IoT endpoints running Arm
  Mbed, provisioned via Arm Pelion, feeding data to Edge servers, that will in turn
  connect to an Ampere eMAG server hosted by Packet.com. <br /> <br /> More specifically,
  the IoT endpoints are collecting environmental readings such as temperature, humidity,
  air quality, particulates, and lightning detection from a series of Raspberry Piâ€™s
  distributed across the globe. <br /> <br /> Regional 96Boards Edge Servers are collecting
  data from the IoT endpoints in their assigned zone, and packaging the data for shipment
  to the cloud server.<br /> <br /> An Ampere Cloud server hosted by Packet is doing
  the large data processing activities, and running Grafana Dashboard for visualization
  of the IoT data flowing into the system. <br /> <br /> The entire collection of
  systems will be centrally managed and the IoT nodes allow for service provisioning
  via containers pushed to the devices, no matter their location, due to the Pelion
  application.<br /> <br /> From a presentation perspective, we will talk through
  the infrastructure build, issues and challenges along the way, and potential use
  cases. Then we will open up to discussion, to solicit feedback and hopefully find
  solutions to the challenges faced.<br />
