description: The LKFT project exists to serve kernel developers and the kernel development
  community.<br /> <br /> In the roughly two years that LKFT has existed, we have
  run over 60 million tests and sent hundreds of bug reports and patches upstream.<br
  /> <br /> Based on what has worked well for us, and what hasnt, we are in the middle
  of a large refactor of our build and boot processes. The result will allow us to
  build and test more kernels, more quickly, with much more variety and granularity.<br
  /> <br /> Looking forward, there will be a focus on custom reporting and analytics
  that will allow us to get the precise data that kernel developers and communities
  need to make their jobs easier.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
