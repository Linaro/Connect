description: XRT is open source FPGA/ACAP runtime environment developed by Xilinx
  and hosted on GitHub -- https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT. It provides abstractions
  for common hardware/software interactions like compiled program download, DMA operations,
  memory management, execution control, device management etc. The runtime provides
  unified API for PCIe acceleration devices and edge SoCs. This talk will provide
  an overview of XRT and describe its modular architecture.
