description: Event tracing is one of the powerful debug feature available in Linux
  Kernel as part of Ftrace. Pstore or Persistent Storage on the other hand is a boon
  to find the cause for the kernels dying breath as rightly said by someone and is
  widely used in production environments. When these two features are combined with
  a pinch of Dynamic debug, we form a full recipe for debugging problems in Linux
  Kernel.<br /> <br /> This presentation talks about integrating event tracing with
  pstore to identify and root cause problems by analyzing the last few events before
  the Kernel says goodbye. In addition to this, we add dynamic debug support to filter
  out unwanted logs and limit trace to only specific files or directories which help
  in narrowing down problems to specific subsystems and currently is not supported
  by Ftrace.
