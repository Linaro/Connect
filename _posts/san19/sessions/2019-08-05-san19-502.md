description: Twitch is a live-streaming platform that creates interaction between
  broadcasters and audiences through chat messages on top of live video. Such a user-generated-content
  (UGC) interactive live streaming model offers a “lean-forward” experience to the
  viewers, which many of them find more interesting than the traditional linear TV’s
  “lean-backward” experience.<br /> <br /> Although desktop browsers still account
  for the majority of Twitch’s traffic, mobile devices are emerging as very important
  client platforms, particularly in Twitch’s fastest-growing markets such as Asia
  and Latin America. On the other hand, we face a number of special challenges when
  trying to optimize the viewing experience on mobile devices. This talk will explain
  Twitch’s engineering effort on multiple aspects of the live video pipeline in order
  to achieve low latency, deploy new codec format, and handle the diversity of client
  devices.
