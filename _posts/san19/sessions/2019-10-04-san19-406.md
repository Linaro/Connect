description: While isolation levels greater than 1 are involved in PSA certificate,
  the existing runtime library for secure partition lacks security consideration and
  contains its own private data, this prevents secure partition calling these APIs
  because of potential information leakage.<br /> A new runtime library needs to be
  available for secure partition with security consideration at the very start of
  design. The design should not break the isolation requirements listed in the PSA
  Firmware Framework specification. This runtime library also needs to be sharable
  for all secure partitions to save storage on IoT device, and it needs to be read-only
  to avoid tampering. And the most important part, no private data could exist inside
  of runtime library.<br /> This new runtime library would keep security isolation
  consideration out of secure partition designers, which make the development environment
  unified for secure partition developers. And save the size for IoT software since
  this library is shared.
