description: As Autonomous Driving (AD) technologies roll out from development to
  deployment, vendors are demanding production-ready embedded solutions. Arm IP becomes
  a natural choice, combining high performance general-purpose compute with custom
  workload-specific acceleration in a reduced power envelope. However, porting existing
  AD software stacks to another platform is not without pitfalls. In this presentation,
  we discuss the challenges faced – with emphasis on hardware acceleration of neural
  networks – porting the open-source Autoware AD stack to an Arm-based system.
