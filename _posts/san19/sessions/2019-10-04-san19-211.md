description: Microsoft and a community of partners created ONNX as an open standard
  for representing machine learning models. Models from many frameworks including
  TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Keras, Chainer, MXNet, and MATLAB can be exported
  or converted to the standard ONNX format. Once the models are in the ONNX format,
  they can be run on a variety of platforms and devices.<br><br>ONNX Runtime is a
  high-performance inference engine for deploying ONNX models to production. Its optimized
  for both cloud and edge and works on Linux, Windows, and Mac. Written in C++, it
  also has C, Python, and C# APIs. ONNX Runtime provides support for all of the ONNX-ML
  specification and also integrates with accelerators on different hardware such as
  TensorRT on NVidia GPUs.<br><br>The ONNX Runtime is used in high scale Microsoft
  services such as Bing, Office, and Cognitive Services. Performance gains are dependent
  on a number of factors but these Microsoft services have seen an average 2x performance
  gain on CPU. ONNX Runtime is also used as part of Windows ML on hundreds of millions
  of devices. You can use the runtime with Azure Machine Learning services. By using
  ONNX Runtime, you can benefit from the extensive production-grade optimizations,
  testing, and ongoing improvements.
