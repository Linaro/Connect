description: Audio is ubiquitous across a wide range of phone, tablet, notebook, speaker,
  headset, appliance, router, telematic, and other modern devices. To fully utilize
  the potential of dedicated audio subsystems on SoCs and other embedded devices with
  minimal engineering investment, an open, modularized, and extensible signal processing
  framework, with associated uniform APIs, is proposed for high performance or cost
  sensitive and power efficient audio applications. An extensible and modularized
  framework provides the flexibility, within the same architecture and codebase, to
  support a wide range of customizable features and capabilities without sacrificing
  the ability to scale up to higher performing, richer processing environments and
  also scale down to smaller, resource limited and cost sensitive environments. This
  presentation describes the key design principles of this advanced audio signal processing
  framework including programming interfaces and development workflow using open source
  community friendly SDKâ€™s and use case design, configuration, and tuning applications
