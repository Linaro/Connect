description: Device Tree (DT) is a core technology that enables us to build flexible
  and adaptable embedded systems. <br /> <br /> Device Tree engineering work is occurring
  in various forums, but there are a number of features that are important to the
  ecosystem but are languishing due to little focus or coordination.<br /> <br />
  Several topics have been identified as critical features that require leadership
  and engineering effort. This is a collaboration project to put some coordinated
  engineering effort into the identified features.<br /> <br /> The session will introduce
  the project and the identified topics.<br />
