description: BuildKit solves many problems of "docker build", instead of replace the
  "docker build", it evolves to be an independent project but still under the umbrella
  of moby. <br /> <br /> In this presentation, I am going to talk the key issues that
  BuildKit addresses, such as concurrent dependency resolution, much faster image
  build with cache import/output, and how to avoid to leak credential while still
  allow accessing private assets.<br /> <br /> You will see how the BuildKit could
  be used in conjunction with docker, particularly, we will see how BuildKit supports
  multi-arch image build for ARM platform, and the Docker as well. Actually, the cutting-edge
  innovation of "docker buildx" is right based on BuildKit, besides, couple of demo
  on top of ARM platform will be given during the session. <br /> <br /> Some performance
  data will be given as well to compare with traditional "docker build".
