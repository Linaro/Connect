description: For many projects that use resource constrained devices, optimizing for
  the smallest code-size is often more important than optimizing for the highest performance.
  The TCWG team would like to share their progress and results on several code-size
  related projects. These include:<br /> - Comparing the code-size of clang and gcc
  for bare metal programs on M-profile devices.<br /> - Adding Arm support to the
  LLVM machine outliner.<br /> - Adding C++ virtual function elimination to Clang.<br
  /> - Building zephyr using GCC LTO.<br /> The presentation will give a brief summary
  of how the clang and gcc compilers compare on code-size, and a description of some
  improvements you can expect in future versions of the compilers.
