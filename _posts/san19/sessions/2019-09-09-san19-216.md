description: '<strong>A view from industry: Securing IoT with Azure Sphere – Ed Nightingale,
  Partner Director of Engineering, Microsoft Azure Sphere</strong><br>Azure Sphere
  offers to improve MCU computing by bringing cloud connectivity, intelligence, and
  high security to these devices. The Azure Sphere solution consists of three components:
  a new class of cross-over MCUs incorporating Microsoft silicon security technology,
  a new OS built around a custom Linux kernel, and a cloud-based security service
  that guards every Azure Sphere-based device on the planet for 13 years.<br><br>In
  this talk, I will explain the market scenarios Azure Sphere addresses, dig deep
  into the silicon and software architecture that compose the Azure Sphere solution,
  and review some of the project’s history. We’ll go into what makes an Azure Sphere
  MCU unique from a security perspective and why an end-to-end solution to IoT security
  is critical to its success in the market.'
