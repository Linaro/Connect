description: Nowadays everyone talks about Kubernetes. There are a lot of landing
  scenarios about running Kubernetes and its very easy for deploy applications with
  Kubernetes. However, due to the limited resource capacity on the edge node, deploying
  a total Kubernetes cluster on the edge node will result in huge resource costs.
  Is there an easy way to bring Kubernetes to the edge node with less resources?<br
  /> Using K3s on edge node offers a vital alternative. k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes
  distribution with easy installation, half the memory and all in a binary, which
  is obviously designed for edge and IOT devices based on Arm64. For easy management
  of several edge K3s clusters, weve also running a Kubernetes cluster on Arm64 datacenter
  side as the "root cluster" for meta-data management and provisioner for all k3s
  clusters running on the edge nodes.<br /> In this presentation, we will talk about
  how to run k3s on the Arm64 edge node, what we have done to make Kubernetes cluster
  running on datacenter side as the root cluster to manage the several k3s clusters
  on edge Arm64 nodes, that will be a good reference architecture for running and
  managing workloads at edge computing area.<br />
