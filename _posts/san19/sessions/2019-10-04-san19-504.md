description: Join us for a session long tour of Fuchsia a new open source operating
  system that features Zircon a microkernel derived from Little Kernel. It purports
  to scale from embedded RTOS to mobile desktop. But does it really? During the session
  well explore whats there, take a few peaks of source code (its public), glean some
  wisdom of the design (fuchsia.dev) and by the end leave you with an appreciation
  of the possibilities represented by the project. <br /> <br /> Note Google is not
  in any way associated with this presentation. Materials are derived from publicly
