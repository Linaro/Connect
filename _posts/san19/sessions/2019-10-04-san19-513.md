description: ARM TrustZone shields the most critical security components from the
  normal world legacy OS, which grows larger and more complex over time and has become
  quite difficult to harden. However, in recent years we have also witnessed memory
  exploits targeting TrustZone systems as well. Such vulnerabilities can be utilized
  by the attackers as the bridge to further subvert the secure OS, thus take over
  the whole device.<br /> <br /> As an important mission of the open source project
  under the MesaTEE platform, we aim to bring memory safety to ARM TrustZone. In particular,
  we enabled Rust programming for Trustlets, making them immune to memory exploits
  by nature while preserving native execution speed. Unlike the previous attempts,
  Rust OP-TEE TrustZone SDK is the first to:<br /> <br /> - utilize the Rust programming
  languages security checks and type checks, so that developers can never misuse;<br
  /> - enable Rust standard library and millions of Rust crates/libraries for developing
  Trustlets, so that developers can conveniently leverage the existing rich Rust ecosystem;<br
  /> - provide automatic Trustlet lifecycle management via the "resource allocation
  is initialisation" (RAII) design pattern, preventing errors where a resource is
  not finalised and where a resource is used after finalisation, so that developers
  no longer bother calling session/context related APIs manually.<br /> <br /> We
  will present our current implementation based on OP-TEE (complying to the GlobalPlatform
  TEE specifications), and will provide demonstrations for popular TrustZone applications
  like secure storage, key management, device identification, authentication, DRM,
  etc. Most importantly, we revolutionarily provide support for trusted and secure
  machine learning computation in TrustZone. To our best knowledge, we are the first
  to offer safe, fast, functional, and ergonomic development for Trustlets.
