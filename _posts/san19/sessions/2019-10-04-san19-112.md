description: Every Linux release is a collaboration of various developers, maintainers
  and sub-system, containing lots of patches and codes and community try their best
  to ascertain the stability as much as possible. <br /> But considering that the
  changes can impact various areas/subsystems/use-cases/architectures, it is not very
  easy and rather impossible to guarantee a stable release. Even ensuring regressions
  is not a straightforward thing. <br /> <br /> Any organization which is considering
  to up-rev their Linux always has susceptibility to risk. Despite the best work being
  done by community of testers, maintainers and developers, how many or how severe
  bugs will get introduced in the re-based Linux is a question not easy to answer.<br
  /> This susceptibility/risk can be reduced with good number of test cases; these
  tests could be specific tests related to organization in terms of the architectures
  they use and the use-cases they support, and various test cases inherited from open
  source. And to have very low risk level, there would be a need to run hundreds/thousands
  of test cases. <br /> Here execution of test cases may take time from hours to days.
  <br /> Other problem with test cases that they are static and never get evolved
  with past learning and experiences.<br /> <br /> We are proposing a AI based tool
  which will help to provide a set of test cases (sub set of hundreds/thousands of
  test cases) which are intelligently picked based <br /> on past learning of driver
  or sub-system or area. This past learning is created based on result of test cases
  run in various previous releases. This subset of test cases can be run <br /> to
  check the stability of Linux and the risk level of an up-rev. This is definitely
  a huge time saving and at the same time will try to identify the problem areas more
  efficiently.<br /> This tool would also publish the list of test cases run and their
  pass/fail result. <br /> <br /> Any organization can then look through the test
  report, check the failed test cases assess the severity of the failures, and decide
  whether they should go for fix or wait for new release. <br /> This tool can be
  run on every Linux release to provide stability level. Other than stability, this
  tool can also tell area/subsystem which are stable or which are very dynamic in
  nature, helping maintainers focus. <br /> <br /> Aim is to place this tool on any
  open web portal which is easily accessible by the community. Also community can
  help with more test cases to enhance tool learning and hence good sub-set of test
  cases. <br />
