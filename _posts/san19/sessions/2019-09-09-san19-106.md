description: 'VIXL is a ARMv8 Runtime Code Generation Library which contains three
  components:<br /> - Programmatic assemblers to generate A64, A32 or T32 code at
  runtime.<br /> - Disassemblers that can print any instruction emitted by the assemblers.<br
  /> - Simulator can simulate any instruction emitted by the A64 assembler on x86
  and ARM platform. It is configurable, vector length for SVE, for example, and it
  supports register tracing during the execution.<br /> <br /> In this talk, were
  going to introduce:<br /> - What is VIXL? It is already deployed and is considered
  “mature”, for example, it has been adopted by Android ART compiler for its ARM backends:
  AArch64 and AArch32. <br /> - CPU feature management and detection.<br /> - New
  Armv8.x instructions support, e.g. BTI, PAuth, etc.<br /> - New SVE (Scalable Vector
  Extension) support.'
