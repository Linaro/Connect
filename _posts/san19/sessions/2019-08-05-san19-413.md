description: Protecting key confidentiality is essential for many kernel security
  use-cases such as disk encryption, file encryption and protecting the integrity
  of file metadata. Trusted and encrypted keys provides a mechanism to export keys
  to user-space for storage as an encrypted blob and for the user-space to later reload
  them onto Linux keyring without the user-space knowing the encryption key. The existing
  Trusted Keys implementation relied on a TPM device but what if you are working on
  a system without one?<br /> <br /> This session will introduce a Trusted Keys implementation
  which relies on a much simpler trusted application running in a Trusted Execution
  Environment (TEE) for sealing and unsealing of Trusted Keys using a hardware unique
  key provided by the TEE.
