description: Python Productivity for Zynq, or PYNQ, has the ability to present programmable
  logic circuits as hardware libraries called overlays. These overlays are analogous
  to software libraries. A software engineer can select the overlay that best matches
  their application. The overlay can be accessed through an application programming
  interface (API). Using existing community overlays, this course will examine how
  to experiment with neural networks using PYNQ on Ultra96.
