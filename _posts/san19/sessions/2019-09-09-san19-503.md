description: Video acquisition, processing, and rendering are key features for a variety
  of different embedded applications and they are heavily used in automotive, monitoring
  and various AI applications. More specifically, I recently had to work on implementing
  camera support for a microcontroller running Zephyr RTOS. There is no existing support
  for camera in Zephyr, but like any other component, creating a common and generic
  subsystem/API benefits the community and encourages video component support work.
  Several software proposals, including one of my own, are currently under review
  and maybe even part of Zephyr when you read these words. We will review a few camera
  basics, the different ways to drive them and how to design a suitable subsystem/API,
  taking into account scalability, latency and memory footprint. We will conclude
  with a summary of the current upstream status and the status of any outstanding
  pull requests.
