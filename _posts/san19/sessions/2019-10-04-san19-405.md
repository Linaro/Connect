description: With the increasing size and complexities of Hadoop-related clusters
  every day, how to lift them becomes a challenging task.<br /> <br /> The Apache
  Ambari is aimed at monitoring, provisioning and managing Hadoop-related ecosystem
  deployment.<br /> Management Packs (MPacks) enables Ambari to remove the tight coupling
  with existing stacks (HDP, HDF, etc.) from Ambari core and flexibly manage any Hadoop-related
  service into Ambari. <br /> <br /> Collaborating with Linaro LDCG, we validate Apache
  Ambari and implement a new Ambari Arm64 Mpack to make Hadoop deployment and management
  simpler on Arm64 servers. We also adopt Apache Bigtop to consummate Hadoop-related
  Arm64 stack.<br /> The introductory session will provide the overview of Ambari
  and Bigtop. And we will give an in-depth perspective into Arm64 Mpacks architecture.
  The followup demo will showcase the process of Hadoop-related stack deployment on
  Arm64 servers.
