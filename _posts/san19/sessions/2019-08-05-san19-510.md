description: Getting electronic devices onto internet and well connected with each
  other hasnt been a trivial task for the engineering community, always challenged
  by end price of the product, software scalability from devices running firmware
  to complex devices running complete OS distro, lack of fine tuned libraries and
  framework to introduce security of data, over the air upgrade and configuration
  and calibration of devices, supporting both head and headless units. Though the
  industry met the end user demand and floating requirements in time, the challenges
  continue to exist for next generation devices<br /> where the focus is on integrating
  multiple key components like<br /> security, networking, graphics, AI and ML libraries
  and sensor control frameworks into one singe device. While solving the system integration
  requirements is a key thing the other equal important aspect of ensuring the software
  is maintained for bug fixes, long term supported, simultaneous support for multiple
  SOCs and controllers is very much essential.<br /> <br /> The end equipment manufacturers
  have various software options to chose from and each have their own advantages and
  disadvantages, inbuilt features and support infrastructure. Chromium OS is one of
  the latest open source software distributions maintained by Google for almost a<br
  /> decade now has made its way into IOT segments.<br /> <br /> In this session we
  look into the key components in Chromium OS that can help us overcome the software
  challenges in building next generation IOT devices.<br /> <br /> - Chromium OS is
  initially designed for laptops, desktops and stand alone / all inone boxes, the
  well integrated software components like browsers, networking, security, boot options
  and window management can be leveraged as is for IOT devices. We go through few
  of these components to understand if they meet the IOT requirements.<br /> <br />
  - Chromium OS is built on Linux, thereby the OS has support for multiple latest
  SOCs and device drivers for various controllers. We should be discussing if chromium
  OS has picked up all the latest trends in Linux OS related to Power Management,
  security, upgraded device driver frameworks, etc.<br /> <br /> - In general IOT
  devices are headless or less UI centric, we explore if chromium OS can be easily
  configured to boot on a headless unit ?<br /> <br /> - Understanding the system
  requirements, memory requirements and power utilization are few key factors to consider
  if the OS fits the budget available for the end equipment.<br /> <br /> - The new
  set of IOT devices are now pre-integrated with AI algorithms to help end user for
  better understanding of the surrounding or indecision making etc. The devices are
  also self learning with ML algorithms. Its important to know if Chromium OS has
  frameworks to download AI/ML algorithms or firmware at run time on DSPs or SOCs.
  Also ensure if there are HALs and APIs to exchange data to/from DSPs or SOCs running
  AI/ML algorithms.<br /> <br /> The topics covered in this session should help us
  quickly assess if chromium os is favorable for IOT devices or if we were bringing
  an elephant in the room.
