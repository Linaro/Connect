description: Till now all keys stored in OP-TEE secure storage are secured at rest
  by encrypting it with FEK.<br /> But when these keys are being used for operations
  these keys are kept in plain format in OP-TEE internal structures.<br /> <br />
  This is because cryptographic operations in OP-TEE are currently done with software
  libraries(libtomcypt and mbedTLS), and cryptographic operations are nothing but
  mathematical operations, so software libraries need private keys in “plain format”
  for operations.<br /> <br /> Keeping these keys in plain format makes them vulnerable
  to following attacks with respect to confidentiality and integrity which is main
  objective of Trusted Execution Environment.<br /> - By exploiting any vulnerability
  in code such as buffer overrun or bugs like Heartbleed.<br /> - Using side channel
  attacks such as cold boot attack - in which an attacker with physical access to
  a computer performs a memory dump of a computers RAM by performing a hard reset
  of the target machine.<br /> <br /> Since nature of hardware-based cryptography
  ensures that the information stored in hardware is better protected from external
  attacks, so above issue can be fixed when these keys are backed by some hardware
  component. We need some mechanism in which the keys doesn’t exist in plain format
  in secure memory.<br /> <br /> Hardware component will export the private keys only
  in encrypted form to secure memory.<br /> During operations takes private keys in
  encrypted form and convert them into plain format internally and do operations with
  them.<br /> Even If attacker gets access to this key in secure memory somehow, will
  not be able to find out the actual key.
