description: Important stakeholders in the personal-OS arena have switched to the
  BFQ I/O scheduler, to endow their systems with a very low I/O latency. The story
  differs with enterprise systems tough. By controlling I/O with BFQ, these systems
  would reach a 5X-10X throughput boost. Nevertheless, almost all stakeholders still
  stick to uncontrolled I/O. For various reasons they fail to see the economic benefits
  that may follow from the above boost.<br><br>At the other end of the spectrum, Facebook
  seems to see these benefits so clearly that they have invested in the design and
  implementation of two brand new I/O controllers for Linux. The latter control, respectively,
  latency and bandwidth. And these are the two main goals of BFQ.<br><br>In this presentation
  we try to shed a light on this sort of controversial situation, by showing some
  performance figures. In<br>particular we show again (the poor) performance without
  I/O control, after which we compare the performance of these new controllers with
  that of BFQ.

- speaker_bio: Paolo Valente is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the
    University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and a collaborator of the Linaro
    engineering organization. Paolos main activities focus on scheduling algorithms
    for storage devices, transmission links and CPUs. In this respect, Paolo is the
    author of the last version of the BFQ I/O scheduler. BFQ entered the Linux kernel
    from 4.12, providing unprecedented low-latency and fairness guarantees. As for
    transmission links, Paolo is one of the authors of the QFQ packet scheduler, which
    has been in the Linux kernel until 3.7, after that it has been replaced by QFQ+,
    a faster variant defined and implemented by Paolo himself. Finally, Paolo has
    also defined and implemented other algorithms, part of which are now in FreeBSD,
    and has provided new theoretic results on multiprocessor scheduling.<br /> <br
