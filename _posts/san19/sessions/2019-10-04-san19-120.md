description: As a unified distributed storage system, Ceph provides applications with
  object, block, and file system interfaces.<br /> Considering TCO, we setup a full
  disks arm servers ( (11 HDDs + 1 SSD) / per node ), which offers an optimal balance
  of storage utilization, performance, and cost, may act as a reference design for
  future arm storage deployment.<br /> This session introduces performance tuning
  practice on this cluster, is intended for storage architects, engineers who want
  to deploy Ceph storage on arm servers using proven best practices.<br />
