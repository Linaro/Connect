description: We have experienced very successful open source development for Linux
  operating system. But in the firmware area, most of the developments are carried
  out by some major organizations without the participation of community. Application
  driven open source development enables a software system ecosystem which can adopt
  various hardware components, including different architectures, and let the vendors
  deferential and create tangible results. Open source firmware and Standard firmware
  interface is critical to enable different hardware implementation for the same ecosystem.
  In this secession we will discuss how to join and contribute to an open source firmware
  project managed by Linaro. The key principles of this project are as following<br
  /> • General System Firmware not specifically targeted for phone, client, server
  or cloud.<br /> • Universal interface supporting multiple OSes including Linux and
  Windows<br /> • Adaptive to various silicon especially silicone provided by member
  companies<br /> • Encourage open technology and early standard implementation<br
  /> • New TianoCore license model or similar<br /> • Long Term Stable release instead
  of product driven
