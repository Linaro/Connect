description: Zephyr is already ported on number of STM32 SoC platforms, but so far
  was limited to run on one core. The introduction of the dual cores STM32H7 series
  (Providing Cortex-M7 and Cortex-M4) lead us to implement and run Zephyr on the both
  cores. <br /> <br /> This talk will detail the issues and the solutions used by
  STMicroelectronics to enable Zephyr on the both cores,. It will cover topics like
  dual core boot, resources sharing and inter-core communications.
