description: Arm’s Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) has introduced a new challenge
  to the debugger world where vector register size is unknown until run time and also
  can change during execution. Arm has been innovating in the past year or so to live
  up to the challenge of SVE in GDB. Linaro has begun to do the same for the LLDB
  debugger in the LLVM toolchain world. In this talk we will briefly introduce SVE
  and its impact on debugger’s register access design. Moreover, we will discuss SVE
  support in LLDB, will give an overview of the whole effort and will provide updates
  about completed, in progress and completed tasks.
