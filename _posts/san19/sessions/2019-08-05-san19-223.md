description: 'Perf has joined a growing number of tools able to act as userspace interface
  to eBPF. Not only that but it can also reprise its historic role as the best interface
  to the Linux performance monitoring sub-system to profile eBPF programs installed
  by itself or any other eBPF front end.<br /> <br /> This session will mainly give
  updates for latest support for Arm CoreSight and eBPF in perf, and also will see
  how to Arm CoreSight can be used for eBPF program profiling.<br /> <br /> This session
  will be divided into two main parts; the first part will focus on the updates for
  Arm CoreSight tracing, includes sample flags and integration perf for test support.
  In the bottom part, it will discuss the eBPF usage with perf tool: perf uses eBPF
  program for system call tracing; perf profiles the eBPF program by using the general
  PMU events and Arm CoreSight event.<br /> <br /> This session will be finished within
  25 minutes; in the CoreSight hacking session we will concentrate on questions<br
  /> and demonstrations as the supplement to the presentation.'
