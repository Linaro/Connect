description: Armv8.2 features has been announced a few years ago, but the uptake of
  Armv8.2 features in Android has been slow. In 2018, flagship Android phones with
  ARMv8.2 features start to appear in the market. It is important that Arms partners
  products fully exploit the latest architectural features.<br /> <br /> In this presentation,
  we will share our story of deploying ARMv8.x features in Android Runtime (ART),
  go over the challenges and solutions for enabling those features in lower Android
  layers, and the optimisations we eventually developed in ART with ARMv8.x instructions.<br
  /> <br /> We will also share the simulator solution we developed for testing & debugging
  ARMv8.x features easily for Android Runtime without the need of actual hardware.
