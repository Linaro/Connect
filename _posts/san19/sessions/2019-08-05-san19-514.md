description: Graal is a dynamic compiler that integrates with the HotSpot JVM and
  converts Java bytecode to native machine code at runtime. It can be a replacement
  of the C2 compiler in Hotspot with the basic advantage that Graal is written in
  Java rather than C++, which makes it probably safety and easier to maintain and
  extend. Besides, Graal compiler has a focus on high performance so its also a big
  part of what makes Java as faster as it is.<br /> <br /> Currently Graal has added
  many optimization mechanisms like speculative optimizations, inlining, partial escape
  analysis, lowering snippets, etc. Even so, compared to the C2 compiler, Graal still
  lose some optimizations and new features of OpenJDK especially for AArch64. Its
  performance could be better.<br /> <br /> This presentation explores the status
  of Graal Optimization on AArch64, together with the performance data of some benchmarks.
  Some of the focus is on the recent changes and the improvement in AArch64 port which
  Arm contributes to. Some of the future works may also be introduced.
