description: With higher Gigahertz and multiple cores packed in a SoC the need for
  thermal management for ARM based SoCs gets more and more critical. Thermal governors
  that define the policy for thermal management play a pivotal role in ensuring thermal
  safety of the device. Choosing the right one ensures the device performs optimally
  with in the thermal budget.<br /> <br /> In this presentation Keerthy Jagadeesh,
  Co-maintainer TI BANDGAP AND THERMAL DRIVER explores the behavior of existing governors
  like step_wise, fair_share, bang_bang governors on A15 based DRA7 SoCs as an example.
  Governors perform differently based on the Number of Cores the SoC packs, the process
  node and the use cases. The results on DRA7 family of SoCs will be used to provide
  guide lines while choosing a particular thermal governor for a given SoC based on
  the above mentioned parameters.
