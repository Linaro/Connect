description: Arm-based systems are showing up in the HPC community and new silicon
  is coming. The architecture has also been selected for several of the exascale projects
  worldwide. Brent will talk about the aspects of Arm that are attractive to the HPC
  community, updates on projects and what we as a community can do to help accelerate
  adoption in this space.

    in the mid-80’s in Canada, he wrote compilers for Myrias Research. In the early
    90’s he moved to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and worked on the
    adoption of parallel computing. In the early to mid 2000’s, he ran the BlueGene
    project for Livermore as well as the Lustre file system contract. Brent founded
    and was CEO at Whamcloud, a company formed to keep Lustre in play for HPC. After
    selling Whamcloud to Intel, he was General Manager for the High Performance Data
    Division for 5+ years. Along the way, Brent had a hand in starting Software-Carpentry.com,
    building the first Java compiler and founding the Student Cluster Competition
