description: System firmware involves many software and hardware specifications and
  verifying implementation correctness manually is often difficult. Firmware Test
  Suite (FWTS) is a open-source test suite licensed by GPL and is recommended as the
  ACPI 6.1 Self-Certification Test by UEFI Forum. FWTS comprises a large set of tests
  and performs sanity checks on various aspects in firmware. It aims to detect errors
  in systems and to recommend fixes for firmware developers. This command line tool
  is easy to use and provides explanatory and informative results according to specifications
  including ACPI, UEFI, SBBR and many other more.
