description: SOC vendors are often regarded as not being good open source citizens.
  &nbsp;They tend to work downstream with upstream being an afterthought -- if its
  even being thought of at all. &nbsp;This is contrary to open source community practices
  and can cause friction when engineers operating in these different modes try to
  interact. &nbsp;There are often good reasons, and sometimes not-so-good reasons,
  for this type of behavior. &nbsp;In this talk I will attempt to give more insight
  into why SOC vendors are downstream-focused, what types of issues motivate this
  behavior, and how we can better bridge these ecosystems to "pop the bubble".
