description: Arm and its partners are rapidly gaining ground in high performance computing
  with supercomputers based on Arm’s server-class IP (a.k.a. Neoverse) in production
  at leadership computing facilities worldwide. An unprecedented number of open source
  and commercial HPC software developers are actively tuning their applications for
  these new platforms. This presentation expands on the “Arm in HPC” keynote to encourage
  growth and collaboration in the Arm HPC community by introducing the available technologies,
  methodologies, and resources for HPC developers interested in migrating their applications
  to Arm Neoverse. The first 25 minutes of this presentation will review of the state-of-the-art
  in supercomputer deployments and software applications, introduce HPC developer
  tools from Arm and the HPC community, and conclude with tips and tricks for porting
  high performance computing applications to Neoverse supercomputers. If 50 minutes
  are available for this presentation, we will also include tips and tricks for porting
  vectorized HPC applications to Arm’s Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and introduce
  a performance quantification methodology for SVE based on the Arm Instruction Emulator
  (ArmIE). We will demonstrate how highly tuned HPC applications can be ported to
  SVE when those applications have made assumptions about the hardware vector width
  and discuss the performance implications of vector width agnostic (VLA) programming.
  The presentation will conclude by presenting community resources for HPC developers
  and extending an invitation to future community events.
