description: The Vanguard program looks to expand the potential technology choices
  for leadership class High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. The first deployment
  of Vanguard is Astra, a Petascale ARM supercomputer sited at Sandia National Laboratories.
  Astra is the first and currently largest ARM Supercomputer and looks to prototype
  the ARM ecosystem not only for the NNSA/DOE but also the greater HPC community.
  This talk will first discuss on the architectural details of Astra, as well as the
  Advanced Tri-Lab Software Environment (ATSE) which provides an overview of the software
  and hardware platform. Then, we will share the latest activities in performance
  results, scalability studies, and lessons learned thus far. We expect this will
  help inform the greater HPC community on the viability of the ARM ecosystem.<br
