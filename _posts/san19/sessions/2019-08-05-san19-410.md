description: This presentation will start by going over the latest features that have
  been added to the CoreSight subsystem in the last 6 <br /> months. <br /> <br />
  From there we will provide a brief recap of the hardware capabilities of the CoreSight
  Embedded Cross Trigger infrastructure and introduce the newly created Cross Trigger
  Interface (CTI) driver and programming API. We will also provide some use cases
  and programming examples.<br /> <br /> Lastly we will present an outline of the
  proposed CoreSight Complex Configuration framework, a set of tools and driver updates
  to allow users to extract the full capabilities out of CoreSight infrastructure
  with a simple client interface.
