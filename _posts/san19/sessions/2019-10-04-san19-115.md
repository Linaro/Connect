description: Todays heterogeneous SoCs are very hard to configure. Issues like which
  cores, memory and devices belongs to which operating systems, hypervisors and firmware
  is done in an ad-hoc, error prone way. System Device Trees will change all that
  by extending todays device trees, used by Linux, Xen, uboot, etc. to describe the
  full system and also include configuration information on what belongs where. This
  talk will describe the issues involved and the proposed solution together with a
  demo of a prototype.
