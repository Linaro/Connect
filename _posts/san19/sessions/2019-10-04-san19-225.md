description: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have an increasing role in the
  security of embedded systems and one of the leading open-source solutions is OP-TEE
  by Linaro. As more and more security-critical tasks are moved to the TEE, the complexity
  and thus risk of vulnerabilities increases as well. By now it are small operating
  systems running trusted applications and having a system call interface exposing
  drivers and other services.<br><br>In this talk we present a fuzzing framework for
  OP-TEE using an unmodified version of AFL with coverage tracking integrated in the
  TEE kernel using compile-time injected hooks. This framework can be used to test
  any code running in the kernel such as the interface exposed to the non-secure the
  world, as well as trusted applications embedded in the kernel and the system call
  interface by providing the coverage data to the non-secure world.<br><br>We discuss
  the challenges of fuzzing a (trusted) operating system running nonvirtualized on
  an actual device as well as our approach that allows using an unmodified version
  of AFL running as Linux application in the non-secure world. Additionally, we discuss
  how we created a useful set of initial inputs to seed AFL. The approach discussed
  in this talk is not limited to OP-TEE but could be used for any (trusted) operating
  system.<br><br>Last, we discuss some of the latest improvements to the framework,
  making it more efficient and some of the issues found by fuzzing OP-TEE.

- speaker_bio: Martijn Bogaard is a Senior Security Analyst at Riscure where he focuses
    most of his time on analyzing the security of low-level embedded software (bootloaders,
    operating systems) and is slowly expanding into embedded hardware security. Recent
    research interests include the effects of fault injection on software, TEE (in-)security
    and levering the hardware to attack software.
