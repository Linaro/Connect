description: The goal of the presentation is to help people in non-development roles
  understand and navigate the complex world of technology. &nbsp;All are welcome.
  Those with a technical background may find the session too introductory.<br><br>The
  first part of the presentation looks at some of the deliverables found on releases.linaro.org
  and how they fit in a typical product development life cycle. More specifically
  we start with how the 96boards standard helps developers get going at the prototyping
  phase of a project and speed up time to market. From there we explore the concept
  of toolchains and how programmers use them in their daily work. The third aspect
  of the presentation gives an overview of what libraries are and the advantages of
  using them when building a system.<br><br>
