description: Performance optimizations underpin great advances in the system efficiency
  of Arm-based devices, with C and C++ toolchains at the heart of code-generation
  technology for the Arm architecture. In this session I will give an overview of
  the work of the C/C++ compiler performance team at Arm, and discuss our recent successes
  and priorities for the coming year.
