description: WPEWebKit[1] is a WebKit flavor (also known as port) specially crafted
  for<br>embedded platforms and use-cases. During this talk I would present WPEWebKits<br>architecture
  with a special emphasis on its multimedia backend based on<br>GStreamer[2] and implementing
  support for the MSE[3], EME[4], MediaCapabilities<br>specifications. I would also
  present a case study on how to successfully<br>integrate WPEWebKit on i.MX6 and
  i.MX8M platforms with the Cog[5] standalone<br>reference web-app container or within
  existing Qt5 applications, using the WPEQt<br>QML plugin.<br><br><br>[1] https://wpewebkit.org<br>[2]
