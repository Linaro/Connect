description: AWS is a leading cloud-service provider with the goal of providing the
  best customer experience. ARM has a unique place in the whole ecosystem – both at
  server and edge devices. In this talk, I will explain how AWS Sagemaker Neo accelerates
  deep learning on EC2 ARM A1 instances and ARM-based edge devices to improve customer
  experience. AWS Sagemaker Neo uses TVM, an open-source end-to-end deep learning
  compiler stack.
