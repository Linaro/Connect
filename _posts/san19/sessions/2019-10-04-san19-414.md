description: Cloud Native is an approach to building and running applications that
  exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. It typically means
  to use containerized open source software stack, dynamically orchestrated and managed
  to optimize resource utilization.<br /> To build cloud native NFV infrastructure,
  in addition to containerized NFV orchestration engine, such as Kubernetes, we need
  high performance, scalable and micro-service oriented networking solutions to support
  the requirement of high performance network applications and services. <br /> In
  this presentation, we would like to show the data plane acceleration(DPDK) usage
  and programming technique in building the cloud native NFV infrastructure on arm:<br
  /> 1. The data plane acceleration programming in support for high performance user
  space network stack with event model on arm;<br /> 2. The data plane acceleration
  usage model in high performance inter-hosts Kubernetes container networking solutions;<br
  /> 3. The para-virtualized data plane acceleration accessing mechanism(vhost/virtio)
  in supporting high performance container connection with virtual switches, such
  as VPP, OVS<br /> 4. The data plane acceleration utilization in cloud native applications
  deployment and service providing;<br /> 5. The performance tunning factors and analysis
  of data plane acceleration configuration in cloud native NFV infrastructure deployment
