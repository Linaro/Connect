description: The Arm SCP-Firmware provides a reference firmware implementation for
  the System Control Processor (SCP) and Manageability Control Processor (MCP) components
  found in several Arm Compute Sub-Systems. It provides Power Management and System
  Control functionality that is compliant with the Arm System Control and Management
  Interface (SCMI). The SCP-Firmware is based on a modular design which caters to
  multiple deployment models. The SCP Firmware lends itself to easy deployment, whether
  RTOS or bare metal. It is based on a core Framework which provides common services
  to all modules. The Modules plug into the framework and implement functionalities
  which can be chosen on a per-platform basis. This provides complete flexibility
  for any platform or implementation to provide their own modules and ‘special implementations’
  as required. Additionally, the SCP Firmware abstracts Execution Context requirements
  enabling it to be deployed in a wide variety on systems and architectures and even
  run on host environments.<br /> <br /> In my presentation, I will talk about how
  the SCP firmware positions itself in Power management paradigms based on the division
  of responsibilities between the OS kernel and the firmware. We will briefly go through
  the Framework and Module design and how they provide flexibility to a platform to
  enable fast deployment. We will also talk about the way the various firmware components
  communicate with each other using events and notifications, which can be well abstracted
  from the underlying execution context. The advantages that the SCP firmware provides
  due to its lightweight and flexible scheduling model which can scale from single-threaded
  to multi-threaded will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the guidelines for
  developing code based on the opensource SCP-Firmware and the benefits of doing so.
