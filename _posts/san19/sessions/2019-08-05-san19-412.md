description: Recently, compiler optimizations and their improvements for AArch64 have
  been actively added to GCC and LLVM. For optimizations for HPC applications, GCC
  with a Fortran front end is superior to LLVM. In this presentation, we compare the
  code generated by GCC and LLVM for kernel parts of HPC applications on AArch64,
  and investigate the current problems of LLVM and propose solutions for them.
