description: Testing a large python application, like LAVA, can be sometime tricky.<br><br>The
  first part of the talk will focus on classical python testing features like pytest
  and mocking.<br>The second part of the talk will concentrate on some specific tools
  that where developed to test LAVA itself (meta-lava, DummySYS, ...). These tools
  and the corresponding ideas could also be used to test other systems.
