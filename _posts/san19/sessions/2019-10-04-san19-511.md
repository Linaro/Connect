description: Arm and partners have been contributing extensively to library functions
  projects. It will be in the best interests of Arm software eco-system to maximize
  the value of those contributions. An amplifier will be reusing the open-source implementations
  in multiple projects. An aggregator is for anyone to collaborate the contribution
  by submitting new functions or enhancing/fixing existing functions.<br /> <br />
  However, reuse and collaboration will not just happen without appropriate license
  and copyright model. There are legal risks like license compatibility and copyright
  assignment that have to be addressed properly.<br /> <br /> Optimized Routines is
  an open source project that serves as the core of a solution to clear obstacles
  of reusing and collaboration. It uses a liberal license, the MIT license, and is
  the copyright of a single organization. This method of releasing software under
  a more permissive license in the first instance prevents the software being locked
  into restrictive licenses and allows much greater freedom for the Arm eco-system.<br
  /> <br /> This presentation will the issues in reusing and collaborating of open
  source libraries, show how the Optimized Routines addressed them and the progress
  of collabrating contributions into this project.<br />
