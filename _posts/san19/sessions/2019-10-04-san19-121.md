description: Trusted Firmware M (TF-M) is an open source implementation of Platform
  Security Architecture (PSA) for Arm Cortex M processors. TF-M provides secure services
  to other cores or non-secure execution environments using PSA APIs on the M profile
  core. It includes services like secure storage, security audit trails, and crypto,
  amongst others. PSA Firmware Framework (PSA-FF) compliant APIs are used for inter-process
  or inter-processor communication with the secure services.<br /> <br /> This session
  will discuss how to run Zephyr on a non-secure core, calling TF-M services on a
  secure TF-M core. A dual-core Cortex M33 will be used, with OpenAMP as the IPC protocol
  between the Zephyr and TF-M core. This session will also examine PSA level 1 requirements
  for PSA certification, such as the use of a secure boot loader.
