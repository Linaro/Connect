description: Azure Sphere is a solution for building highly secured, connected microcontroller-powered
  devices. It includes a customized version of the Linux kernel and work to fit the
  OS within a highly constrained memory footprint. In this talk we will cover the
  security components of the system, including a custom Linux Security Module, modifications
  and extensions to existing kernel components, and user space components that form
  the security backbone of the OS. Along the way weâ€™ll discuss false starts, failed
  attempts, and the challenges of taking modern security techniques and fitting them
  in resource constrained devices.
