description: Testing a large python application, like LAVA, can be sometime tricky.<br
  /> <br /> The first part of the talk will focus on classical python testing features
  like pytest and mocking.<br /> The second part of the talk will concentrate on some
  specific tools that where developed to test LAVA itself (meta-lava, DummySYS, ...).
  These tools and the corresponding ideas could also be used to test other systems.
