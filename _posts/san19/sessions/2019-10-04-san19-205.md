description: Today JVM remains one of the most popular programming and execution platforms.
  There are different approaches to leverage GPU power from the JVM, which can be
  useful for many specific cases. ARM-based hardware brings JVM benefits on the edge.
  This talk will demonstrate different ways of interoperability between GPU and JVM.
  We will evaluate the APIs and the performance of hybrid Java-GPU code. For the practical
  part of the talk, we will use Jetson Nano as an example of modern, powerful, but
  affordable edge equipment.

- speaker_bio: Dmitry Chuyko is a performance engineer at BellSoft, that is among
    the top 5 contributors to OpenJDK. Before joining BellSoft, Dmitry programmed
    in Java, and then worked on Hotspot JVM in Oracle. After all, previous experience
    with Java has shown that the most interesting problems in applications get their
    solutions in the base platform. Currently Dmitry mostly optimizes OpenJDK for
    x86 and ARM, the company even implemented its own optimizing JEP 315 in Java 11.<br
    /> BellSoft releases and supports Liberica JDK â€” a verified distribution of OpenJDK.
    Liberica is available in the form of binary assemblies, installers and container
    images for different operating systems and processors. Therefore, now the focus
    of attention is the work of various versions of Java in containers.
