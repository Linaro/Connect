excerpt: In STMicroelectronics we developed a set of tools for an efficient exploitation
  of application system trace under Linux, which we decided to make open source. The
  presentation will focus first on the current OSS tool offer, show which improvements
  can be made, then present ST proposed solutions compatible with Linaro Coresight
  framework (KPtrace, System Trace and Profiling Tool Kit) and a stepwise upstreaming
  plan.
