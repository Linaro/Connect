excerpt: Android runtime (ART) has evolved from an AOT compiler (in Android L & M)
  to a hybrid mode runtime (in Android N) which combines fast interpreter, JIT compiler
  and profile guided AOT compiler. In this talk, we'll take a look at all these important
  changes in Android N. For example, the design and implementation of JIT, hybrid
  mode, tooling support, etc. This talk is meant to help Linaro members and developers
  to have a deeper understanding of ART in Android N, and to help them face the challenges
  of the new behaviors of Android runtime.
