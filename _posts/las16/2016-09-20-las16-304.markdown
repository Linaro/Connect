excerpt: "In composing RTOS-based images to run on embedded systems, there are number
  of different issues that come into play that are different from building a root
  fs for Linux. Issues such as how third-party libraries and code link with the OS,
  how we pull down the code, etc. Additionally, such systems may also need to support
  the creation of filesystem-based images. There are several options that exist today
  (\u201Cnewt\" - a tool from the Apache Mynewt project in the Apache Software Foundation;
  \u201Cyotta\" - from Arm mbed; the Yocto Project; and more). This session will discuss
  required features, compare and contrast project approaches, and potential additions
  and changes that are needed in this space."

LAS16-304: Mini Conference 2 RTOS-Zephyr - Build Systems
Speakers:
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
In composing RTOS-based images to run on embedded systems, there are number of different issues that come into play that are different from building a root fs for Linux. Issues such as how third-party libraries and code link with the OS, how we pull down the code, etc. Additionally, such systems may also need to support the creation of filesystem-based images. There are several options that exist today (“newt" - a tool from the Apache Mynewt project in the Apache Software Foundation; “yotta" - from Arm mbed; the Yocto Project; and more). This session will discuss required features, compare and contrast project approaches, and potential additions and changes that are needed in this space.
