excerpt: This session will give an overview of Zephyr Project. Zephyr is a small,
  scalable, real-time operating system designed specifically for small-footprint IoT
  edge devices. Its modular design allows you to create an IoT solution that meets
  all of your device needs, regardless of architecture. It is also embedded with powerful
  development tools that will, over time, enable developers to customize its capabilities.
  Launched in partnership with the Linux Foundation, the Zephyr project is a truly
  open source solution focused on empowering community development. The goal of Zephyr
  is to allow commercial and open source developers alike to define and develop IoT
  solutions best suited for their needs.
