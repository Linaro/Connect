excerpt: "This presentation will discuss issues and common mistakes when migrating
  a project from one toolchain to another. The main focus will be on issues coming
  from switching from GCC to Clang, but we will also touch on differences in libraries,
  assemblers and linkers. The presentation will also make fun of bad practices and
  quick hacks that project porters sometimes use to \u201Cmake-it-compile\u201D."
