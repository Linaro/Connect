excerpt: "Cities are getting identified as smart cities based on what and how data
  are used to do predictive analytics. Smart City as a phrase can have a wide spectrum
  of meaning. But there are two key things (Data and Analytics) that \u2018smart\u2019
  refers to in smart city. With IoT gaining so much market attention, brings in the
  power to drive the implementation. Data collection, Storage and Analytics provide
  so much potential. This talk will go over a sample use case scenario utilizing ODPi
  based Hadoop eco system and H20 visualizations for analytics."

★ Session Description ★
Cities are getting identified as smart cities based on what and how data are used to do predictive analytics. Smart City as a phrase can have a wide spectrum of meaning. But there are two key things (Data and Analytics) that ‘smart’ refers to in smart city. With IoT gaining so much market attention, brings in the power to drive the implementation. Data collection, Storage and Analytics provide so much potential. This talk will go over a sample use case scenario utilizing ODPi based Hadoop eco system and H20 visualizations for analytics.
