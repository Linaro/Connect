excerpt: 'The Energy Aware Scheduler relies on a power model, rather than on heuristics,
  to make decisions and reduce power usage. As a result of this fact-based decision
  making EAS presents very few tunables and thus requires a significantly different
  approach to tuning and optimization when compared to the traditional tune/benchmark/repeat
  cycle. Tuning EAS has perhaps more similar to debugging: using trace tools such
  as ftrace, kernelshark and LISA, we can examine its decision making and look for
  ways to improve this decision making. This talk will offer a practical introduction
  to using these trace tools.'

LAS16-TR04: Using tracing to tune and optimize EAS (English)
Speakers: Leo Yan
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
The Energy Aware Scheduler relies on a power model, rather than on heuristics, to make decisions and reduce power usage. As a result of this fact-based decision making EAS presents very few tunables and thus requires a significantly different approach to tuning and optimization when compared to the traditional tune/benchmark/repeat cycle. Tuning EAS has perhaps more similar to debugging: using trace tools such as ftrace, kernelshark and LISA, we can examine its decision making and look for ways to improve this decision making. This talk will offer a practical introduction to using these trace tools.
