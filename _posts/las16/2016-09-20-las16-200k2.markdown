LAS16-200K2: Corporate Open Source Fail – Sarah Sharp
Speakers: Sarah Sharp
Date: September 27, 2016

★ Session Description ★
**Title: Corporate Open Source Fail**

What makes companies with good intentions fail so miserably at open source? How can we (as engineers and managers) influence our bosses to “do the right thing”?

“We’ll just make a new open source community.”
“You can fix up that code later.”
“It’s taking too long to get this upstream.”

Many companies have good intentions of being productive open source citizens. However, those good intentions often get thrown under the bus when product deadlines or legal issues loom. This talk will walk through a series of common corporate open source pitfalls and the executive and manager thinking behind those decisions. We’ll discuss ways engineers and managers can develop empathy for their corporate overlord’s needs, in order to influence their strategies around open source.
