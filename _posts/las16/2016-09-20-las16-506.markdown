excerpt: Hardware and software will never stop evolving, yet many still choose to
  push out static documentation without the resources to maintain, edit, and push
  new versions. When these documents inevitably become obsolete, they float around
  the internet and offer little more than confusion. In many cases you will find yourself
  with more questions than answers by the end of an instruction set, with no one available
  to help. 96Boards aims to end outdated documentation by implementing a dynamic approach
  which utilizes member and community resources, paired with on point maintenance
  and diligent review from the 96Boards team and Linaro. Doing this, we can provide
  up-to-date, straightforward, and accurate documentation without the need to share
  documents, convert formats, or refer to releases/versions when wondering if the
  document is going to work.

LAS16-506: The future of 96Boards documentation
Speakers: Robert Wolff

★ Session Description ★
Hardware and software will never stop evolving, yet many still choose to push out static documentation without the resources to maintain, edit, and push new versions. When these documents inevitably become obsolete, they float around the internet and offer little more than confusion. In many cases you will find yourself with more questions than answers by the end of an instruction set, with no one available to help. 96Boards aims to end outdated documentation by implementing a dynamic approach which utilizes member and community resources, paired with on point maintenance and diligent review from the 96Boards team and Linaro. Doing this, we can provide up-to-date, straightforward, and accurate documentation without the need to share documents, convert formats, or refer to releases/versions when wondering if the document is going to work.
