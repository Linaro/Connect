excerpt: "**Title: IoT Zephyr**\n Overview of IoT Zephyr\n \n **Bio**\n Geoff Thorpe
  heads up security within the Microcontroller group of NXP, where the intersection
  of device security and network security gives him a headache commonly known as “IoT”.
  His early experience with security topics was very software-centric, as a long-standing
  member of the OpenSSL team and a contributor to related open source projects. After
  many years veering off into semiconductors and hardware architecture, his software-bias
  has been domesticated to some extent but not eradicated."

Speakers: Geoff Thorpe
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
Title: Overview of IoT Zephyr

Bio:
Geoff Thorpe heads up security within the Microcontroller group of NXP, where the intersection of device security and network security gives him a headache commonly known as “IoT”. His early experience with security topics was very software-centric, as a long-standing member of the OpenSSL team and a contributor to related open source projects. After many years veering off into semiconductors and hardware architecture, his software-bias has been domesticated to some extent but not eradicated.
