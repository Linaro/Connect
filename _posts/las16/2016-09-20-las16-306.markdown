  To deal with this problem, several companies (Arm, Solacia, Symantec, Intercede)
  collaborated on the Open Trust Protocol (OTrP), which combines a secure architecture
  with trusted code management, using technologies proven in large scale banking and
  sensitive data applications on mass-market devices such as smartphones and tablets.
