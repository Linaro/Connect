excerpt: The CoreSight framework available in the Linux kernel has recently been integrated
  with the standard Perf trace system, making HW assisted tracing on Arm systems accessible
  to developers working on a wide spectrum of products. This presentation will start
  by giving a brief overview of the CoreSight technology itself before presenting
  the current solution, from trace collection in kernel space to off system trace
  decoding. To help with the latter part the Open CoreSight Decoding Library (openCSD)
  is introduced. OpenCSD is an open source library assisting with the decoding of
  collected trace data. We will see how it is used with the existing perf tools to
  provide an end-to-end solution for CoreSight trace decoding. The presentation will
  conclude with trace acquisition and decoding scenarios, along with tips on how to
  interpret trace information rendered by the perf tools.
