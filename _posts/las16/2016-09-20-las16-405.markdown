excerpt: You may think OpenDataPlane and DPDK are somewhat equivalent. But they are
  not. OpenDataPlane is about Software Defined Dataplanes while DPDK is a Software
  Dataplane. A Software Defined Dataplane can control a hardware only Dataplane in
  a way that packets can go from input port to output port without reaching a CPU
  core. With Software Dataplanes , all packets have to reach a CPU core. As a result,
  one vendor could leverage a Software Defined Dataplane to build a 100Tbps network
  box while it is not possible with a Software Dataplane.
