excerpt: SoC Vendors, board vendors, software middle layers, scripting languages,
  etc all need to have access to system configuration information (pin muxes, what
  sensors are on a system, what amount of memory, flash, etc, etc). We need a means
  to convey this in a vendor neutral mechanism but also one that is friendly for Cortex-M/constrained
  footprint devices. This session will be to discuss the topic, how its done today,
  what kinda tooling might exist from different vendors, what we could utilize (device
  tree) and what issues that creates.

LAS16-300: Mini Conference 2 RTOS-Zephyr - Device Configuration
Speakers: Andy Gross
Date: September 28, 2016

★ Session Description ★
SoC Vendors, board vendors, software middle layers, scripting languages, etc all need to have access to system configuration information (pin muxes, what sensors are on a system, what amount of memory, flash, etc, etc). We need a means to convey this in a vendor neutral mechanism but also one that is friendly for Cortex-M/constrained footprint devices. This session will be to discuss the topic, how its done today, what kinda tooling might exist from different vendors, what we could utilize (device tree) and what issues that creates.
