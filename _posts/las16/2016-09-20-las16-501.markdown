LAS16-501: Introduction to LLVM - Projects, Components, Integration, Internals
Speakers: Renato Golin
Date: September 30, 2016

★ Session Description ★
Deep dive into LLVM internals, middle/back-ends, libraries, sanitizers, linker, debugger and overall compilation process. The focus is to show how LLVM works under the hood, which is useful for GCC compiler engineers getting into LLVM development, as well as for other engineers to learn more about parts of the toolchain they’re not familiar with. This presentation also touches on frequent LLVM-specific errors, so GCC users may find useful, if they’re moving to LLVM.
