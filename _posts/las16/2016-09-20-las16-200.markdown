excerpt: 'The Linaro Enterprise Group has been driving the work to implement, upstream
  and maintain UEFI and ACPI support on Arm platforms since its creation in 2012.
  Over the years, the team has initiated new activities, namely the OpenPlatformPkg
  proposal to support multiple SoCs and multiple platforms in EDK2, as well as supporting
  more and more features on ACPI, e.g. recently, Console Selection, APEI, PCIe, NUMA
  and new GIC implementations. In order to successfully deploy Arm servers in production,
  it is required that firmware (BIOS) engineers and kernel engineers work in close
  collaboration and drive the addition of new platforms, improved SoC support, etc.


  Recently Linaro founded devicetree.org to support making device tree a properly
  managed and supported standard. This includes reducing fragmentation, improving
  maintainability and increasing multiplatform support in hardware description thanks
  to an open process that encourages wide community participation and the current
  best practices and technology.


  The purpose of this conference is to bring the key developers and maintainers from
  all camps in the same place, review the status and plan the next steps.


  Title:Arm64 ASWG and Linux ACPI update

  Abstract: As presented at previous connects an update on the current support for
  Arm64 at ASWG level and the hot topics. Also an update on the support that is mainline
  in the Linux kernel for Arm64 ACPI support. Also covering the next steps for both
  ASWG and Linux support. Followed by a discussion period.

  Speaker: Al Stone, Hanjun Guo

  Notetaker: Graeme Gregory


  Title: SCMI - System Management and Control Interface

  Abstract: In this session we present a new standard proposal for system control
  and management. The industry, both in high end mobile and enterprise, is trending
  towards the use of power and system controllers. In most cases the controllers have
  very similar communication mechanisms between application processors and controllers.
  In addition, these controllers generally provide very similar functions, e.g. DVFS,
  power domain management, sensor management. This standard proposal provides an extensible,
  OS agnostic, and virtualizable interface to access these functions.

  Title: Tianocore Progress and Status

  A brief update on the progress of Arm64 support in EDK2 and OpenPlatformPkg. Also
  covering the next steps. Followed by a discussion period.

  Speaker: Leif Lindholm

  Notetaker: Graeme Gregory


  Title: Secure Boot

  A 101 style introduction to what Secure Boot is as Secure means different things
  to different people. Covering the current status, what features are implemented
  currently on Arm64 and what features should be implemented in the future. Followed
  by a discussion period.

  Speaker: Ard Biesheuvel

  Notetaker: Graeme Gregory


  Title: RAS What is it? Why do we need it?

  A 101 style introduction to RAS, its purpose and how we use it on Arm64. Covering
  current status of implementation in ASWG specs and Linux kernel. Plans for future
  features that are essential for Arm64. Followed by a discussion period.
