The history of open source is littered with incredible communities: thousands of people connected around the world building new technology and innovating. We can do better though. We are a facing a new era of challenges and opportunities for collaboration at a global level. In this presentation from Jono Bacon, he will explain how we can build a new generation of communities that are more efficient and more productive than ever before.
