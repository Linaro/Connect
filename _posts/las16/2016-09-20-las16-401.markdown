excerpt: OpenDataPlane provides a portable framework for data plane acceleration that
  is the basis for higher-level functions such as the full IP protocol stack provided
  by OpenFastPath (OFP). ODP+OFP in turn can be used to offer acceleration to applications
  like the open source NGiNX web server. This talk discusses experiences using these
  tools with a focus on the performance and scaling benefits of using ODP and OFP.
