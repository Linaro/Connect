### Help GiveMeTap; win a prize!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should have left Linaro Connect SFO15 with a GiveMeTap bottle sponsored by Arm. Between now and the next Connect in Bangkok 7-11 March take selfies with your GiveMeTap bottle outside [Taps around the world](http://taps.givemetap.co.uk/).

If there aren’t any Taps close by, you can try and persuade potential Taps in your area to [join the program](http://www.givemetap.co.uk/pages/join-givemetap).

Send your photos and Tap recruitment stories to [competition@linaro.org](mailto:competition@linaro.org). Prizes will be awarded at [Linaro Connect BKK16](http://connect.linaro.org/) based on the positive impact your selfies demonstrate.

Each bottle Arm has sponsored gives a person in Africa clean drinking water for 5 years. Find out more about GiveMeTap [here](http://www.givemetap.co.uk/).
