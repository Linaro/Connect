description: 26 million lines of code. 750,000 commits. 61,000 files. "Continuous
  integration and deployment of the Linux kernel is impossible", they said. We believe
  its definitely within reach.<br /> <br /> The Continuous Kernel Integration (CKI)
  project wants to fundamentally change the kernel developer workflow by adding continuous
  integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). In this talk, the audience will embark
  on a journey of triumph and tragedy through the experiences of a small team at Red
  Hat.<br /> <br /> Major Hayden, principal software engineer at Red Hat, will explain
  how kernels are built and tested within the CKI infrastructure and what testing
  is already in place today. He will take a deep dive into the infrastructure components
  (including Gitlab, Jenkins, and containers) and the optimizations that allow for
  rapid testing of the Linux kernel. Members of the audience will also learn how they
  can get involved in the project.
