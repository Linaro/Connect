excerpt: This session will cover Comcast's experience of migrating RDK to the OpenEmbedded
  build framework. It will cover the porting of Comcast specific devices and the impact
  on the software design, as well as what was involved in porting efforts - both good
  and bad. Attendees will be able to gather a list of best practices for OE and a
  concrete list of steps for RDK when porting to new devices or doing development
  with the RDK platform. In addition it will cover some of the more pressing issues
  and challenges and how Comcast solved some of the problems e.g. developer workflow,
  continuous integration and delivery
