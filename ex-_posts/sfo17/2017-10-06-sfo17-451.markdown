★ Session Summary ★
The next flagship supercomputer in Japan, replacement of the K
supercomputer and thus we call it post-K supercomputer, is being designed
to be operated in early 2020s.  Its node architecture and interconnect
are respectively Arm V8 SVC and a 6-D mesh/torus network designed by
Fujitsu.  The system software developed for the post-K supercomputer
includes a novel operating system for general-purpose manycore
architectures, low-level communication and MPI libraries, and file I/O
middleware.  After introducing an overview of the post K architecture,
the current status of the system software development will be presented.
