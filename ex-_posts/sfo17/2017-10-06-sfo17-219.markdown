excerpt: During the 4.6 development cycle, the operating performance points (OPP)
  framework gained the infrastructure to do dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
  (DVFS) on behalf of device drivers. This helps in reducing the complexity of those
  drivers, which can instead focus on platform-specific details. The rest of this
  article discusses what has changed and how can we use it to simplify our device
  drivers.
