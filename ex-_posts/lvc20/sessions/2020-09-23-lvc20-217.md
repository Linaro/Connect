description: Open Source license compliance is a concern for any company which distributes
  systems containing the Linux kernel and other copyleft-licensed components. The
  Yocto Project, a widely used Embedded Linux toolkit including the OpenEmbedded build
  system, contains many tools to help companies achieve license compliance. Output
  from a Yocto Project build can also be fed into other license compliance software
  such as Fossology. In this talk Paul will explore these tools, address how best
  to configure & connect them and discuss current best practices. Paul will explore
  how modern programming languages such as Go, Javascript and Rust cause license compliance
  headaches due to their separate package managers and how to resolve these issues.
  He will show how to handle common concerns such as commercially licensed media codecs
  and GPLv3 licensed software components. He will also bring the audience up to date
  with the latest developments and ongoing work in this area of the Yocto Project.<br><br>This
  talk will cover technical best practices and available tools, it will not give legal
  advice.
