description: Most of the optimisation works of the Linaro Android Runtime team are
  based on results of benchmarks. The benchmarks are either lightweight benchmarks,
  such as Dhrystone, benchmarksgame, caffeinemark, or micro-benchmarks. They were
  enough at the beginning of the Android Runtime (ART) development but the more ART
  evolved the more difficult became to assess the usefulness of optimization works.
  We needed more realistic benchmarks.<br><br>In this talk, I will share the ART team
  experience of bringing benchmarks from the Java world to Android. The biggest issues
  we had. We managed to port SPECjvm2008 workloads. They already have proved to be
  useful. They showed that an optimization added to the instruction scheduler gave
  real improvements. They also helped to identify about 40 opportunities for optimization
  in ART.<br><br>I will also give an overview of other Java benchmarks, such as DaCapo
  and Renaissance suite, we are planning to have. Our plans include the use of open-source
  Android apps for benchmarking code size, compilation time and startup time. Another
  area we are interested in is open-source Kotlin benchmarks.
