description: It seems the Rust programming language comes up frequently these days,
  and there is a lot of interest in it. We have been using Rust to implement a simulation
  test environment within MCUboot since 2017. This presentation will discuss our experience
  with Rust, and our hopes of how this language might help other projects in the future,
  especially in regards to security.
