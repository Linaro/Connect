description: Security is a major concern for IoT deployments. Platform Security Architecture
  (PSA) provides a framework for building secure IoT devices. Trusted Firmware-M is
  the PSA Open Source Reference Implementation aligning with PSA certified guidelines
  addressing common IoT threats. TF-M creates a Secure Processing Environment providing
  a set of Secure Services including Secure boot flow on Cortex-M CPUs that is widely
  used in IoT devices.<br><br>There is a dramatic variation in IoT usecases varying
  from smart home bulbs, thermostats, personal health monitors to sensors deployed
  in critical urban infrastructure and factories. These devices have different security
  requirements due to the difference in assets and trust associated with them. Deploying
  and Maintaining Security in these devices over its lifetime involves cost including
  memory and performance consumption of these devices. Therefore, it is important
  for TF-M to provide different configurations to satisfy security requirements of
  these different classes of IoT devices.<br><br>TF-M Profile provides Small, Medium
  and Large configurations with increasing level of Security functionality allowing
  device manufacturers to choose (and further customize if required) a profile based
  on Threat Model and Security Analysis of their usecase. Profile Small. Medium and
  Large configurations will be supported in TF-M Project and therefore deployable
  on a variety of Cortex-M based Silicon platforms.<br><br>The session will provide
  an overview of how Trusted Firmware-M makes it easier for IoT Application developers
  to enable Security on their devices. The session will cover the need for TF-M Profiles
  and features included in each Profile.<br><br>The session will demonstrate how Profile
  Small (aimed at memory and performance constrained devices) can be used to create
  a Secure device meeting the requirements for PSA Certified Level1 and connect securely
  with other devices.
