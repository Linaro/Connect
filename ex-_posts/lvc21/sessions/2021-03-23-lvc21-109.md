description: Trusted Services is a new trustedfirmware.org project that provides a
  home for security related service components that may be integrated and deployed
  in different secure processing environments.  Whether running under OP-TEE as a
  trusted application, within a secure partition or on a secondary MCU, services that
  implement platform security function such as secure storage, cryptography and fTPM
  can be built using common components, interface definitions and test cases.  The
  presentation provides an introduction to the project and describes how a common
  framework can help with reuse and standardization.
