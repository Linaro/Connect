Compass CI is an open source test platform and service.
It's an OpenEuler project to test OSS projects (Linux kernel, QEMU, MySQL etc.)
on different combination of hardware architectures and Linux distributions.
We also go beyond regular testing to help developer get bugs fixed:
regressions are auto detected, bisected and reported
1. rerun a test by re-submitting its job, possibly with modified parameters
2. compare performance among test runs
3.one single command to borrow a testbox, deploy test environment and ssh login
