description: 2020 was a watershed year for open source graphics drivers on Arm. For
  years, every Linaro Connect has asked when open drivers would come -- finally, they
  have. For Mali, open source support for Bifrost materialized with the Panfrost driver,
  working together with Arm. Adreno is seeing the open source Freedreno drivers shipping
  in production. This presentation will give an annual status update for open drivers
  for Arm GPUs with a view of what's to come.
