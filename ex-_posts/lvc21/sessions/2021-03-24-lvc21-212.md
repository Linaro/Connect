Trusted Firmware - M (TFM) supports the Firmware Framework - M (FF-M) 1.0 features to demonstrates the usage of PSA compliance secure software. The collected usage feedbacks showcases important points users care about, such as the interrupt usage, calling efficiency and conceptual items clarification.

FF-M is updating to 1.1 to address the feedbacks, including an updated interrupt handling model, improved calling efficiency by simplifying both client API and service implementation model, clearer clarification on isolation boundaries, rules and domains. TFM would update to represent these changes in the specification.

This topic describes the FF-M 1.1 features update plan and technical pre-design inside TFM. The goal of this update is to provide a better user experience while implementing a PSA compliance system with TFM.
