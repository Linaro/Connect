Autoware is world's first ""All-in-One"" open-source software stack for autonomous driving technology. It provides a complete set of self-driving modules, including localization, detection, prediction, planning, and control.

Recently, the prospering of edge computing technology has seen a growing trend towards distributed workloads. Containerizing and orchestrating Autoware on edge is a meaningful exploration towards the real-life scenario of Autoware in autonomy vehicles.

In this demo, using the reference hardware Neoverse N1 System Development Platform (N1SDP), we present a system contains the containerized Autoware components. The Autoware containers are orchestrated by a light-weight orchestrator - k3s. This demo provides new insights into deploying autonomous driving software in distributed edge systems.
