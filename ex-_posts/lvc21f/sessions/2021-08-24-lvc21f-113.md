  The Arm Architecture is continually evolving to meet the needs of our ecosystem
  partners. Arm, Linaro, and the wider ecosystem build on the foundations of the Architecture,
  creating a rich and varied range of products along with associated Firmware and
  Software, driving the technology of the future. This talk will introduce the 2021
  extensions to the A profile architecture, ahead of the release of the updated register
  and instruction set XML. It will discuss the software enablement that has been going
  on, and the future development needs of the wider ecosystem, to ensure that software
  is available when physical products are delivered.
