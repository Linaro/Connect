**Description:**
In a world of a trillion connected devices, Firmware security must be seen as a shared responsibility across different market segments, from Cloud to IoT. Trusted Firmware is an open governance community project, providing a collaborative platform for everyone in the ecosystem to work together on open source reference implementations of Secure world Software & Firmware on the Arm architecture, for both resource-constrained Microcontrollers and powerful Application Processors.
In this talk Matteo and Shebu will present the latest exciting news from the project, showing the constantly increased community engagement and discussing both recent updates and forward-looking plans for Trusted Firmware, as the comprehensive reference implementation for secure world software and secure services on Arm systems.
