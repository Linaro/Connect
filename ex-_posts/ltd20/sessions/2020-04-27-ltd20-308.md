**Description:**
The Yocto Project has been working over the last few months on a proposal to introduce Long Term Support releases (LTS).

The upcoming YP 3.1 release, planned for April 2020, is expected to become the first Yocto Project LTS release.

This presentation will focus on the following items:

* Why the Yocto Project needed a LTS.
* How the Yocto Project LTS release will be implemented.
* What are the consequences on the Yocto Project ecosystem and what help is needed from the wider community.
