excerpt: The Arm ecosystem needs full stack development tools, currently you need
  an Intel machine to develop for Arm. This makes developing for Arm a 2nd class citizen.
  The need is shown greatly in the datacenter where we need developers and engineers
  to start working on Arm as a 1st class citizen. To enable this developers need access
  to Armv8 based development systems with UEFI and ACPI capability.  From small NUC
  like devices (with expandable memory and SATA ssd/disk), to Arm powered notebooks
  and workstations (that provide PCIe, SATA and DIMM). Finally Arm server access as
  cloud/baremetal instances for production testing.  This session is to gather requirements
  and review options that can be provided/developed.
