excerpt: This session is an introductory course on Linux kernel upstreaming fundamentals.
  The course covers the definition the Linux mainline kernel tree as well as the maintainer
  hierarchy and processes used to contribute software into the mainline kernel. Special
  focus is given to understanding what documentation will help understand the process
  and mechanics in more detail while breaking the workflow into the various steps
  of upstreaming software patches. The target audience is both software engineers
  and engineering managers preparing to upstream software into the kernel. The topic
  requires a solid background in software configuration management terminology and
  the git SCM tool as well as a good technical understanding of the Linux kernel itself.
