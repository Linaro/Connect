excerpt: KVM for arm/arm64 is maturing and reaching its goal of feature parity with
  x86. In this session we will simply update the audience on the development status
  since there has been an extraordinarily large amount of patches to the code base
  recently covering areas including GICv3 emulation, device passthrough (vfio,irqfd),
  VGIC changes, flexible VM physical address size, live migration, debugging, and
  performance monitors. Any pressing development issues at the time of the conference
  will be covered in this session.
