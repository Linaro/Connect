excerpt: QEMU Armv8-A system emulation was completed shortly after LCA14 and has been
  fully upstreamed in QEMU. During this session we will briefly cover the level of
  support and functionality, and we will introduce developers to using QEMU for running
  64-bit Arm kernels and distributions using QEMU. We also developed a small set of
  patches on top of upstream QEMU which allows us to run a 64-bit Android build. We
  will explain the status and efforts coordinated between Google and Linaro, demo
  the working system, and show how developers can start playing with this.
