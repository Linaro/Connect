Nicolas Pitre of Linaro and his team have worked to reduce the size of the Linux kernel and user space binaries to make them suitable for very small IoT applications to enable the Internet of Tiny Linux. Here at Linaro Connect Vancouver 2018, Linaro shows mainline Linux kernel for IoT devices, running with as little as 4MB of RAM here for example Google IoT.
