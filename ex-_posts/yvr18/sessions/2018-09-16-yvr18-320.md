Over the past several months, we have been working with OpenJDK and SpecJBB for profiling on AARCH64.  The purpose of this BoF session is to share common ideas and approaches on working to improve support for Arm.  Topics include but are not limited to working with Operf, analyzing contention by profiling locks, and measuring memory.
