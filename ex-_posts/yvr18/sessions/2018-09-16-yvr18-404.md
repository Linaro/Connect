Devicetree (DT) is the dominate hardware description language for embedded systems. While well established, there is a gap in validation of DT data as dtc (the DT compiler) has limited validation capabilities. Furthermore, DT binding documents are free-form text which makes writing and reviewing difficult. The solution for both problems can be addressed with json-schema language. Using json-schema for binding documentation allows both automated tests on the documentation and validation of DT data. This session will provide a progress update since the last Connect, an overview of writing DT bindings in json-schema and demonstration of the validation of DTs.
