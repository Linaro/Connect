Vendors steadily provide faster and faster storage, evidently meeting
a demand for higher speed and lower latency. Yet Linux easily throws
most of this speed away, in all use cases where multiple entities
compete for the same storage. Examples are:
- a host with several active virtual machines or containers;
- a server--of any kind--serving multiple clients, and possibly
  executing other administrative tasks at the same time.

The cause of this speed loss is as follows. I/O control is the only
solution for providing at least some minimum fairness or bandwidth
guarantees, needed in the above use cases. But, as we show in this
presentation, I/O control easily slows storage down, to even just 10%
of the available speed. This major loss is particularly problematic on
lower-end storage, as well as on heavily loaded systems.

The BFQ I/O scheduler now recovers this throughput loss, but only in
part of the problematic scenarios. Fortunately, we show that an
improvement, still under development, seems to enable BFQ to reach a
high throughput with all workloads we tested so far. Paradoxically,
the gain is so high to make fully utilized lower-end storage
outperform underutilized higher-end media, depending on the hardware
at hand.
