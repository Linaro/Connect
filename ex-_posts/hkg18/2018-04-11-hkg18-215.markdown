excerpt: 'Linaro has been working on making AOSP build with Clang for a long time
  - and our upstreaming of those patches has contributed to the fact that AOSP userland
  is officially built with clang these days.

  It is working out so well that AOSP wants to go a step further and use the clang
  based toolchain for everything including kernels and bootloaders - something we''re
  beginning to tackle.

  This presentation gives an update on where we are, where we''re facing problems,
  and our continued efforts to keep AOSP userland building with newer versions of
  clang than what upstream is using.'

## Session Summary
Linaro has been working on making AOSP build with Clang for a long time - and our upstreaming of those patches has contributed to the fact that AOSP userland is officially built with clang these days.
It is working out so well that AOSP wants to go a step further and use the clang based toolchain for everything including kernels and bootloaders - something we're beginning to tackle.
This presentation gives an update on where we are, where we're facing problems, and our continued efforts to keep AOSP userland building with newer versions of clang than what upstream is using.
