excerpt: 'Linaro Developer Cloud, update and plans.


  The Developer Cloud is a multi-region cloud based on OpenStack built on top of Aarch64
  servers that offers resources to developers, companies and upstream projects to
  step into and enable  the Arm ecosystem.

  This presentation will explain the current status of the project, the changes that
  have been executed as part of the deployment and upgrade to the reference architecture
  v2.0 and how we plan to keep leveraging and supporting some of the LEG efforts such
  as ERP as the underlying operating system and the multiple SDI projects that are
  part of the cloud infrastructure such as OpenStack CI and Kolla. Finally, we will
  do a quick FAQ session.'
