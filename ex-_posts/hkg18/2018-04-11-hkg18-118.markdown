excerpt: Since moving to GitHub, the OpenDataPlane project has been investing heavily
  in customizing Travis and Shippable to support automated regression testing of pull
  requests across a comprehensive list of test profiles. With the addition of Shippable
  this has now extended to native Arm testing. We are currently looking to add performance
  regressions to the existing suite of functional and code coverage tests. This talk
  discusses what is available and how this can be applied to other projects as well.

## Session Summary
Since moving to GitHub, the OpenDataPlane project has been investing heavily in customizing Travis and Shippable to support automated regression testing of pull requests across a comprehensive list of test profiles. With the addition of Shippable this has now extended to native Arm testing. We are currently looking to add performance regressions to the existing suite of functional and code coverage tests. This talk discusses what is available and how this can be applied to other projects as well.
