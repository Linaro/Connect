excerpt:
  This session will introduce the changes to EAS planned for 4.14 kernel, and
  how Arm hopes that EAS will develop in future. EAS has already evolved from an Arm/Linaro
  joint project to involving a much wider community of SoC vendors, Google and interested
  device manufacturers. We will highlight the product-specific pieces remaining in
  the Android Common Kernel EAS implementation, and our plans to provide an upstreaming
  plan for each product feature. In particular, the new 'simplified energy model'
  is designed to provide mainline-friendliness and comparable performance using a
  simple DT expression of cpu power/performance.

## Session Summary

## This session will introduce the changes to EAS planned for 4.14 kernel, and how Arm hopes that EAS will develop in future. EAS has already evolved from an Arm/Linaro joint project to involving a much wider community of SoC vendors, Google and interested device manufacturers. We will highlight the product-specific pieces remaining in the Android Common Kernel EAS implementation, and our plans to provide an upstreaming plan for each product feature. In particular, the new 'simplified energy model' is designed to provide mainline-friendliness and comparable performance using a simple DT expression of cpu power/performance.
