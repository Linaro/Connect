excerpt: 'Introduction to secure storage concepts and design in TF-M. Some of the
  design choices and their rationale, and real use-cases to showcase how secure storage
  fits in the overall system. A sneak-peek into what is next.


  Trusted Firmware M


  In October 2017, Arm announced the vision of Platform Security Architecture (PSA)
  - a common framework to allow everyone in the IoT ecosystem to move forward with
  stronger, scalable security and greater confidence. There are three key stages to
  the Platform Security Architecture: Analysis, Architecture and Implementation which
  are described at https://developer.arm.com/products/architecture/platform-security-architecture.


  _Trusted Firmware M, i.e. TF-M, is the Arm project to provide an open source reference
  implementation firmware that will conform to the PSA specification for M-Class devices.
  Early access to TF-M was released in December 2017 and it is being made public during
  Linaro Connect. The implementation should be considered a prototype until the PSA
  specifications reach release state and the code aligns._'
