excerpt: Today’s world of devices connected to clouds looks set to evolve with more
  intelligence and processing being pushed to the edge or migrating between the cloud
  and the edge. The very definition of edge is evolving too. In this presentation
  we will look at some potential futures made possible by the emergence of the fog
  and its implications for the segments that it embraces.
