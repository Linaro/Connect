excerpt: Ceph is a unified, distributed storage system designed for excellent performance,
  reliability and scalability. Ceph can supply block storage service within Clould
  production. SPDK (Storage Performance Development Kit) is a technology to improve
  the performance of nonvolatile media (NVMe SSD) and networking. The paper will introduce
  how to accelerate Ceph by SPDK on AArch64 platform. SPDK can improve the IOPs of
  Ceph cluster, reduce the data transmission latency and reduce the CPU cost. It will
  make Ceph cluster profit from multi-core advantage on AArch64 platform.
