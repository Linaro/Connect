★ Session Summary ★
Despite many respectable attempts made in past years, the IoT operating system market remains fragile as it emerges, which has been well recognized as one of major pains for the whole IoT community. 

AliOS Things, the little brother of Alibaba group’s OS product portfolio, is the new generation of IoT operating system dedicatedly designed to address the situation, which has been released in 2017 after years of internal development and already attracted lots of attention from the whole ecosystem since that.
