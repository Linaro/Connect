                Linaro Ltd, as host for Linaro Connect, is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events. Linaro events are working conferences intended for professional networking and collaboration in the Linux community. They exist to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at Linaro events or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form of communication or media including email, texting and social media.
            </p>
            <p>
                All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both the Linaro Connect Code of Conduct as well as their respective employerâ€™s policies governing  appropriate workplace behavior, and applicable laws.
            </p>

Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery and unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors..

                If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuance of a warning to the offending individual to  expulsion from the conference with no refund, depending on the circumstances. Linaro reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further Linaro events, trainings or other activities.
