Linaro is pleased to host the Arm on Arm Summit together with Arm and Marvell at Linaro Connect Bangkok 2019.

Over the past two years, there has been significant progress with native Arm development and deployment. Not only is it now possible to develop Arm on Arm at a reasonable cost, there is a multitude of Arm-powered servers and devices to choose from. 

The aim of the summit is to encourage more diversity of supply from Arm hardware vendors by proving value in the ecosystem.

### What do we mean by “Arm on Arm”?

The native development and deployment of software targeting Arm platforms using Arm based hosts, ranging from laptops to desktops to high end servers, along with Arm based DevOps pipelines needed to support modern software workflows.

### Who will be at the Summit? What topics will be covered?

We have got a fantastic line up of speakers from a wide range of companies, including Arm, Linaro, Marvell, Gyrfalcon, Packet.io, Socionext and SUSE. The final schedule will be published shortly but in the meantime, please see the outline agenda below:
