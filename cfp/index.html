                We have now closed the CFP for Linaro Connect YVR18.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linaro Connect is all about providing a platform to discuss and learn about the leading software
                topics, challenges and opportunities in the ARM Ecosystem today. What are the problems, innovations and
                hands-on knowledge that today’s ARM Developers are working on? From the smallest devices (IoT and
                embedded) to big data (enterprise), there is an ARM solution. We welcome proposals for (1) Technical
                Presentation (2) Technical Discussions and (3) Birds of a Feather (BoF). Want to share what you’ve been
                working on? Click on the button below to submit your proposal.
