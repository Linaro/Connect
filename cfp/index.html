We are now collecting proposals for technical sessions at Linaro Connect Vancouver (YVR18).

Linaro Connect is all about providing a platform to discuss and learn about the leading software topics, challenges and opportunities in the ARM Ecosystem today. What are the problems, innovations and hands-on knowledge that today’s ARM Developers are working on? From the smallest devices (IoT and embedded) to big data (enterprise), there is an ARM solution. We welcome proposals for (1) Technical Presentation (2) Technical Discussions and (3) Birds of a Feather (BoF). Want to share what you’ve been working on?
