**Additional Information** 

**Types of sessions**\
As a default, sessions are 25 minutes long including Q&A. 50 minute will be considered for more in-depth sessions.

* Presentation: Speakers share slides and present technical topics. This may include demos. Presentations can have 1 speaker of multiple. Most sessions at Connect are presentation style.
* BoF “Birds of a Feather”: Informal session type with a group who wish to discuss a certain topic without a pre-planned agenda.
* Panel: A panel is a group of people who are engaging in a conversation about a certain technical topic.A moderator leads the discussion by presenting questions to the panelists, ensuring the discussion stays on track, and will also pull audience questions from the chat for the panelists to answer.
* Keynote: Keynotes are selected by the Connect Planning team. If you’d like your presentation to be considered for a keynote, you may select this option. If it is not selected as a keynote, it could still be selected as a presentation.

**Virtual Session Information**\
For LVC21F, we will ask that all presenters pre-record their sessions. Pre-recorded sessions will be broadcasted at the scheduled date and time and we require speakers to be online in the chat area while their session is broadcasted to interact with the audience and answer any questions. If you are doing a panel or another type of session that would work better live, we will make exceptions on a case by case basis. We will be using the same event platform from LVC21 Spring, [PINE tool](https://pine.events/). If your submission is accepted, you will receive further instructions with slide deadlines, registration codes, and session instructions.

**Linaro Connect audience**\
The Connect audience is about 70% technical: engineers, developers, maintainers and roughly 30% business development, execs, VPs.

**Tips**\
Since our event is focused on developers, we choose engineering presentations rather than marketing/product focused presentations. The more technical the content, the better! For inspiration, please see our [Resources Page](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) to view past videos of past Linaro Connect sessions. 

**Code of Conduct**\
Please refer to our code of conduct regarding session content and event participation: https://connect.linaro.org/code-of-conduct/
