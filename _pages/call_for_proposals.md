            Linaro Connect provides a platform to discuss and learn about the
            leading software topics, challenges and opportunities in the Arm
            Ecosystem today. What are the problems, innovations and hands-on
            knowledge that todayâ€™s Arm Developers are working on? From the
            smallest devices (IoT and embedded) to big data (enterprise), there
            is an Arm solution. We welcome proposals for technical presentations
            and discussions and Birds of a Feather (BoF).
