            Linaro Connect provides a platform to discuss and learn about the leading software topics, challenges and opportunities in the Arm Ecosystem today. What are the problems, innovations and hands-on knowledge that todayâ€™s Arm Developers are working on? From the smallest devices (IoT and embedded) to big data (enterprise), there is an Arm solution. We welcome proposals for technical presentations and discussions and Birds of a Feather (BoF).
