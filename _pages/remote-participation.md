All keynotes will be live streamed on the Linaro [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/LinaroOrg/)and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/linaroorg) pages. 

We do not live stream general sessions, but if there is a session you are particularly interested in having live streamed, please email us at connect@linaro.org. 

Social media posts will be tagged with #BUD20 and #LinaroConnect 

Videos of sessions will be posted throughout the week on our [Resource page](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/). 

Presentation slides for sessions will be available on the [Resource page](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) as well as attached to each individual session in the event schedule in Sched.com
