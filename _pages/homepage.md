            Linaro Virtual Connect 2020 will be held September 22-24, 2020 online.

            Linaro Connect provides a platform to discuss and learn about the leading software topics, challenges and opportunities in the Arm Ecosystem today. What are the problems, innovations and hands-on knowledge that today’s Arm Developers are working on? From the smallest devices (IoT and embedded) to big data (enterprise), there is an Arm solution. Want to share what you’ve been working on? Submit your proposal today!

            If your submission is accepted, you will receive further instructions with slide deadlines, registration code, and virtual session preparation instructions. Due to a limited amount of session slots available, not all submissions can be selected for Linaro Virtual Connect 2020.
            do all we can to repurpose as much of the content as possible. We have created Linaro Tech Days - A livestream event of technical sessions on 24 and 25 March 2020.
