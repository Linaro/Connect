At the upcoming Linaro Virtual Connect 2021 Fall, we plan to host our first ever Virtual Demo Technology Showcase and networking event on Thursday, September 9 beginning at 12:30 UTC. (Application to participate is now closed).

If you've ever been to a Linaro Connect in the past, you may remember our Demo Friday Technology showcase. Participants of Demo Friday prepared a technology demo on a wide variety of Arm Software topics including--- OS Build & Test, Edge Computing and its many use cases, Linaro and community enablement including Open source development, Native software development, etc. and set up a table where attendees could walk around and view the demos and information and speak with the teams who created the demos. 

**How will it work virtually?**

All registered attendees will be invited to join the "Party Space" on Thursday after the sessions have ended.  The software allows attendees to virtually "walk up" to the demos, watch the demo videos and read more information, and then have the opportunity to interact with the teams who created the demos either using their mic and camera or via the chat.

The party space software integrates with the main event platform, PINE. You will also have the opportunity to network and interact with other attendees who are in the Party Space if you wish.
