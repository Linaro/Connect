            At the upcoming Linaro Virtual Connect 2021 Fall, we plan to host
            our first ever Virtual Demo Technology Showcase on Thursday,
            September 9.


            We welcome all attendees of LVC21F to submit an application to participate by completing the form below. If you've ever been to a Linaro Connect in the past, you may remember our Demo Friday Technology showcase. Participants of Demo Friday prepared a technology demo on a wide variety of Arm Software topics including--- OS Build & Test, Edge Computing and its many use cases, Linaro and community enablement including Open source development, Native software development, etc.


            Other topics of interest for demos:


            96Boards, Android, Automation & CI, Automotive, Big Data, Boot Architecture, Data Center, HPC, Industrial, IoT and Embedded, IoT Fog/Gateway/Edge Computing, Linux Kernel, Machine Learning/AI, Multimedia, Power Management, Security, Standardized Firmware, Tools, Testing & CI, Virtualization.


            **How will it work virtually?**


            Demos will be recorded by the person or team submitting, the video file will be sent to the Linaro Connect events team. We will then incorporate the demo videos into an interactive Demo Technology Showcase during the online event using a software that integrates with the main event platform. The software will allow attendees to virtually "walk up" to your demo area, watch the demo video, and interact with your team using their mic and camera or via the chat function.


            **Timeline:**


            * Deadline to submit demo application: August 16, 2021

            * Notifications of acceptance: August 18, 2021

            * Demo videos due by September 1, 2021
