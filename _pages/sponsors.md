            title: Why sponsor Linaro Connect?
            text: >
                Linaro Connect San Diego 2019 will be the 26th Connect since Linaro started in June 2010. Hundreds of the world’s best Linux on Arm developers come to Linaro Connect each time because they know it is the leading place to meet with the global community and to learn about what is going on in the industry. Sponsorship of the event puts your brand in front of all the event attendees – both the 400+ on-site and all those who participate remotely, as well as the thousands who view the website and social media before, during and after the event.

                We offer bespoke packages to suit every budget. If you’d like to sponsor and have something specific in mind or would like to work with our team to create a sponsorship package specially designed to your company then get in touch!
