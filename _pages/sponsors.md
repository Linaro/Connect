            Linaro Connect San Diego 2019 will be the 26th Connect since Linaro
            started in June 2010. Hundreds of the world’s leading Linux on Arm
            developers come to Linaro Connect to share ideas with fellow
            experts, plan future engineering work and learn what is going on in
            the industry. Sponsorship of the event puts your brand in front of
            all the event attendees – both the hundreds of attendees on-site as
            well as the thousands who view the website and social media before,
            during and after the event.


            If you'd like to sponsor, have a look at our sponsorship options
            below. Alternatively, if you have something specific in mind or
            would like to create a custom package please get in touch!
