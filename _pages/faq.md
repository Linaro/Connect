The deadline varies depending on the country that is hosting Connect as it will affect things like how long it takes to ship the equipment to that country, how long to allow for getting the equipment through Customs, etc.

As a result, the hardware request form itself will display the cut-off date for hardware requests for the current Connect.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
Please note: Any hardware requests received after the displayed cut-off date will not be fulfilled as the shipping date will have been missed.

The general stock of Connect hardware consists of:

- Monitors with VGA and HDMI cables.
- USB mice.
- USB keyboards.
- USB hubs.
- Multi-format power strips so you don't need plug adapters - but your equipment must work at the local voltage, e.g. 110V for North America, 220V for Europe.
- Network switches (note, though, that IT will generally deploy a network switch to half the tables in a hacking room).
- Network cables (various lengths available).

We **do not** provide memory cards, USB keys, speakers or boards of any description.

If you have any other hardware requirements, please follow the instructions in [How do I request hardware for loan during Connect?](/faq/#requestHardwareCollapse) and we will let you know whether or not we can meet your request.
