We were disappointed to have to cancel Linaro Connect Budapest March 2020.  As a way to feature some of the content from the Linaro Connect schedule, we have created Linaro Tech Days.

Linaro Tech Days are a series of technical sessions that will be presented live online for anyone to join. Recordings and slides will be made available on our [Resource page](https://connect.linaro.org/resources/) for those who are not able to join.

We are in the process of finalizing the schedule for March 24 and 25 and will post the schedule here by 11 March 2020.
