Since 2010, Linaro Connect has been the event to attend if you are interested in open source software development for Linux,
tools and the various vertical segment ecosystems that use Arm processors. While the event continues to evolve, one thing
stays the same â€“ it revolves around engineering and will consist of a mix of industry keynotes, engineering presentations
and discussions, and collaborative engineering hacking sessions.

To view slides or videos from the keynotes and sessions from previous Connects, please go to our
[Resources page](/resources/).
